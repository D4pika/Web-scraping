It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.

Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.

Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.

Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.

Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.

Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.

Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded.  Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.

Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines.  The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down.  This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side.  This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks.  It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping.  Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance.  The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches.  It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end.  The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Leveraging advances in material mechanics with meticulous design considerations has produced a body that is uniquely positioned in the dump body market for applications where aluminum bodies are typically used. The SBA1000 is the first body to be constructed completely of Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). The result is a blend of durability and versatility. AHSS is some of the toughest material you will encounter and results in a body that is much more powerful than it looks. The full-size body ensures you can handle larger jobs that smaller bodies couldn’t and the lightweight design is perfect for work where carrying gross weight is important. For the forward thinking owner, the SBA1000 is a great choice for businesses that have used aluminum bodies in the past and come to realize that the limitations of aluminum body construction outweigh the “pretty” factor that some operators may find important. Since RTE bodies are completely primed, corrosion is eliminated. Our on-site painting bays give you the option of choosing any color you want for the best looking results. Contact RTE to speak with a Customer Service Representative to see if your application is a good fit for the SBA1000 Suspended Dump Body. With years of testing already successfully accomplished in real-world working conditions, you can be sure that the SBA1000 will have the same great performance and quality craftsmanship that has become synonymous with Rowe RTE Dump Bodies.

Leveraging advances in material mechanics with meticulous design considerations has produced a body that is uniquely positioned in the dump body market for applications where aluminum bodies are typically used. The SBA1000 is the first body to be constructed completely of Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). The result is a blend of durability and versatility. AHSS is some of the toughest material you will encounter and results in a body that is much more powerful than it looks. The full-size body ensures you can handle larger jobs that smaller bodies couldn’t and the lightweight design is perfect for work where carrying gross weight is important. For the forward thinking owner, the SBA1000 is a great choice for businesses that have used aluminum bodies in the past and come to realize that the limitations of aluminum body construction outweigh the “pretty” factor that some operators may find important. Since RTE bodies are completely primed, corrosion is eliminated. Our on-site painting bays give you the option of choosing any color you want for the best looking results. Contact RTE to speak with a Customer Service Representative to see if your application is a good fit for the SBA1000 Suspended Dump Body.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement.  Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body.  Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel.  The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material.  Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o .  On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively.  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate.  The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure.  It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible.  Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions.  The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting.  Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin.  When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door.  The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer.  This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes.  This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says:  it lays flat with floor when engaged.  This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached.  The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller.  It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor.  When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall.  The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin.  The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance.  The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access.  An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released.  No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body.  Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible.  Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body.  They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released.  For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate.  No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate.  Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options.  RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body.  Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs.  But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body.  It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems.  All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material.  There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from:  36 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield.  The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface.  The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested.  The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions.  The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab.  We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in.  There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector.  Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks.  You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers.  The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet.  These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body.  RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab.  RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust.  We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts.  5.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks.  If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them.  Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”.  You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor.  Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution.  It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards.  In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body.  When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top.  If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement.  RTE uses No.1  SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance.  The Side Boards can be single or double stacked.  The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board.  When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity.  With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks.  Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall.  Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner.  The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required.  The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position.  The tarp is rolled into cab shield.  With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector.  When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position.  There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system.  The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall.  It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies.  The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall.  The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use.  It is available in two material types.  Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material.  Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up.  Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall.  The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body.  Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible.  The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand.  Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever.  The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both.  The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield.  The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body.  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall.  For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade.  Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications.  Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32  in. up to 1/4 in.  For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice.  Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers.  The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance.  Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units.  The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills.  You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight.  Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance.  Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps.  The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points.  They are also useful for body transport.  The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body.  In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free.  And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material.  Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes.  By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced.  Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers.  It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow.  The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper.  Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs.  Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate.  The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line.  The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt.  By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly.  For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application.  They also improve dumping accuracy.  Many options are available for our Spread Aprons.  We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths.  Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons.  We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft.  With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified.  Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads.  RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body.  RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames.  For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body.  The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market.  If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist.  When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft.  All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away.  Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us.  Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body.  RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders.  The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist.  It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded.  Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options.  Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation.  Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications.  Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”.  The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes.  Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space.  They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists.  The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons.  The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body.  They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes.  The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure.  Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance.  Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Stainless Steel bodies are the right choice for applications that face chemical corrosion or severe weather road maintenance. And since Stainless Steel won’t rust, the body will not require paint and will look great for years. Municipalities and Highway Departments often use these bodies, but they are also great for contractor and landscape use where durability is important. Body Lengths from 9 ft to 13 ft are typical with Wall Heights from 14 inch to 36 inch. We also offer some larger sized units.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.

Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.

It combines all the features of their heavy counterparts, but in a smaller package that delivers where it matters most. When weight is as important as durability, you don’t want to sacrifice one for the other. The LTWT line is the solution; you can have the best of both. Available in both Stainless or High Strength Low Alloy Steel configurations.        Tailgate Options        Standard Features    Standard Tailgate Features   Fully Box Formed and completely welded. \\xa0Full Height Vertical Stiffeners and dirt shedding formed top and bottom rails.  Heavy Duty Tailgate Hardware, fully greaseable cast hinge and hinge box, forged tailgate latches.  Crush zone reinforcement. \\xa0Our gate is designed to keep its shape even when exposed to the repeated beating of material flowing out and the return swing of the gate back to the body. \\xa0Bent tailgates are a thing of the past.       Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Drop Side Wall       Description  The Drop Side Wall feature is available on the entire PLD and LTWT body lines. \\xa0The Drop Side Wall has hinged lower fasteners that let the wall swing down. \\xa0This provides exceptional access to the inside of the body from the side. \\xa0This is especially useful when loading with smaller machines or fork trucks. \\xa0It also is perfect for applications where side unloading is preferred, like contractor mulching and landscaping. \\xa0Most Drop Side Walls can be completely removed for total clearance. \\xa0The PLD Drop Side Wall includes two spring assisted latches. \\xa0It can also be ordered with split-side, which keeps the load contained at one end of body while allowing for discharge at the other end. \\xa0The LTWT Drop Side Wall uses a single handle release.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Leveraging advances in material mechanics with meticulous design considerations has produced a body that is uniquely positioned in the dump body market for applications where aluminum bodies are typically used. The SBA1000 is the first body to be constructed completely of Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). The result is a blend of durability and versatility. AHSS is some of the toughest material you will encounter and results in a body that is much more powerful than it looks. The full-size body ensures you can handle larger jobs that smaller bodies couldn’t and the lightweight design is perfect for work where carrying gross weight is important. For the forward thinking owner, the SBA1000 is a great choice for businesses that have used aluminum bodies in the past and come to realize that the limitations of aluminum body construction outweigh the “pretty” factor that some operators may find important. Since RTE bodies are completely primed, corrosion is eliminated. Our on-site painting bays give you the option of choosing any color you want for the best looking results. Contact RTE to speak with a Customer Service Representative to see if your application is a good fit for the SBA1000 Suspended Dump Body. With years of testing already successfully accomplished in real-world working conditions, you can be sure that the SBA1000 will have the same great performance and quality craftsmanship that has become synonymous with Rowe RTE Dump Bodies.

Leveraging advances in material mechanics with meticulous design considerations has produced a body that is uniquely positioned in the dump body market for applications where aluminum bodies are typically used. The SBA1000 is the first body to be constructed completely of Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). The result is a blend of durability and versatility. AHSS is some of the toughest material you will encounter and results in a body that is much more powerful than it looks. The full-size body ensures you can handle larger jobs that smaller bodies couldn’t and the lightweight design is perfect for work where carrying gross weight is important. For the forward thinking owner, the SBA1000 is a great choice for businesses that have used aluminum bodies in the past and come to realize that the limitations of aluminum body construction outweigh the “pretty” factor that some operators may find important. Since RTE bodies are completely primed, corrosion is eliminated. Our on-site painting bays give you the option of choosing any color you want for the best looking results.

Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Sloped Forward Gate       Description  The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is perfect for jobs that require precise control when dumping, such as filling asphalt paver hoppers or spreading gravel. \\xa0The unique design causes the tailgate to easily seal, allowing for quicker response when metering out the material. \\xa0Loads can be partially discharged and then quickly stopped mid-flow. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate is available in 2 configurations: 14 o and 7 o . \\xa0On a 48 in. wall height, this is the same as 12 in. and 6 in. Forward Slope, respectively. \\xa0The Sloped Forward Tailgate option is often combined with the Asphalt Bolster option, which allows for greater clearance near the paver hopper.      Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Air Latch Gate    Description  Actuated by a 3.5 in. large bore air cylinder, our Air Tailgate Latch option provides a convenient way to secure the tailgate from within the cab. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The rear latch mechanism is fully adjustable to allow the operator complete control of the closing force on the tailgate. \\xa0The smart design of the latch mechanism ensures the gate will stay closed even in the event of loss of air pressure. \\xa0It is a reliable way to secure your load and operate in the safest manner possible. \\xa0Available in pneumatic push/pull valve control or electric switch control.      Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

Barn Door Swing Gate       Overview  The Barn Door Swing Gate option is a multi-functioning tailgate assembly that allows for two types of tailgate actions. \\xa0The fully greasable upper rear hinge knuckle is double-acting. \\xa0Firstly in conventional dumping, the tailgate opens with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0When the Barn Door Swing Gate feature is engaged, the robust double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to swing like a door. \\xa0The Barn Door Swing Gate opens all the way against and parallel to the side wall and can be safely secured in the open position with the built-in retainer. \\xa0This completely opens the back of the body, making access room for large equipment to straight load bigger objects, like tree stumps or construction rubbish, without the need for overhead hoists or cranes. \\xa0This option is available on almost our entire line of bodies, including Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body, Round Body, Standard Post Side Body, and PLD contractor bodies.      Lay Flat Spread Gate    Overview  The Lay Flat Spread Gate does exactly what its name says: \\xa0it lays flat with floor when engaged. \\xa0This is useful for situations requiring loading or unloading from the rear by shovel or other non-dumping methods. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate also works just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0It can also be completely removed when a rear spreader is attached. \\xa0The Lay Flat Spread Gate is available for tailgates 44 in. tall and smaller. \\xa0It is a popular choice for utility, municipal, and contractor jobs.      High Lift Tailgate       Overview  The High Lift Tailgate option works with a large bore air cylinder to lift the tailgate up and away from the floor. \\xa0When fully raised, the tailgate will be 22 in. above the top wall. \\xa0The strong double acting upper rear hinge allows the gate to work just like a conventional tailgate with a top mounted hinge pin. \\xa0The air cylinder is made in America to exacting standards to ensure smooth operation and long lasting performance. \\xa0The fully enclosed air-line system eliminates the possibility of entanglement and the fully welded debris shield provides cylinder protection and access. \\xa0An in-cab control makes operation easy and a built-in safety feature prevents the High Lift action until the Air Tailgate Latch has been released. \\xa0No more bent tailgates or cylinders.      Coal Chute/Meter Gate       Overview     The Coal Chute option is an opening at the bottom of the tailgate that can be opened at several positions to allow for precise control of emptying material (not just coal!) from the body. \\xa0Choose one, two, or three Coal Chutes installed in the tailgate for ease of access and side spreading. The standard placement is in the middle, but placement to either side is possible. \\xa0Available for the complete line of RTE dump bodies.      Sludge Lock       Overview  These latches are used in addition to the rear latch to clamp the tailgate to the body. \\xa0They are manually tightened and the tailgate cannot come open until they have been manually released. \\xa0For some flowing payloads, a tighter seal must be kept around the perimeter of the tailgate. \\xa0No tailgate is watertight, but Sludge Locks provide a simple solution to keep most other materials sealed inside the body.      Grab Handles    Overview  Grab Handles can be installed on tailgates to provide a location for operators to safely open the tailgate. \\xa0Protect your hands and fingers.      Panel Configurations       Overview  Our tailgates are available with single, double, 3-panel, 6-panel, or 9-panel fully boxed options. \\xa0RTE recommends 9-panels for our Standard Post Side Body and 6-panel for our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body. \\xa0Lighter bodies can benefit from the reduced weight of the single, double, or 3-panel option.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The type and size of material used in your tailgate can be specified to match the requirements of the job. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the tailgate baseplate and normally that is sufficient for most jobs. \\xa0But for heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Similarly, our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body, if you expect the tailgate to take extended abuse. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Headsheet Options        Cab Shield       Overview  RTE has an extensive line of Cab Shields to provide protection for the chassis cab and driver from excess material being dumped into the body. \\xa0It also is the mounting feature for electric operated tarp covering systems. \\xa0All Cab Shields are constructed from High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 material. \\xa0There are 3 lengths of Forward Projection to choose from: \\xa036 in. Full Cab Shield, 27 in. Half Cab Shield, or 15 in. Quarter Cab Shield. \\xa0The Standard Cab Shield features an adjustable height installation system and tarp mounting surface. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield is used on Crossmemberless Smooth Side Bodies, but can be added to a Standard Post Side Body, if requested. \\xa0The Integrated Cab Shield incorporates the tarp mount system into a single unit, resulting in a clean profile that looks as good as it functions. \\xa0The motor is positioned so it is completely within the profile of the Cab Shield, eliminating annoying overhang that drivers must avoid when entering or exiting the cab. \\xa0We offer two sizes of Wind Deflectors, 9 in. or 13 in. \\xa0There is also the new aerodynamically improved “Aero-Max” Wind Deflector. \\xa0Cab Shields can be fabricated to fit between exhaust stacks. \\xa0You can specify any cab shield height you need, usually based on your chassis and cab selection. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Cab Shield Lights       Overview  Make your unit stand out visually by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, Round Marker, or Top Mounted lights to the front, sides, or top of your Cab Shield. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Window       Details  A Headsheet Window will provide visibility from the cab into the body to check on the condition of the load or to assist in back up maneuvers. \\xa0The size and location from the chassis frame is needed to position the window exactly where you need it.      Shovel/Broom Holder       Overview  Shovel, broom, or scraper holders can be installed on the front of the Headsheet. \\xa0These make a great location to hold loose items in the space between the cab and the body. \\xa0RTE has a Shovel Holder Data Form to complete to ensure proper sizing and positioning.      Exhaust Clearance       Exhaust Clearance  Some trucks have exhaust systems that are mounted behind the cab. \\xa0RTE has a unique solution to keep the body as close to the cab as possible while still maintaining clearance with the exhaust. \\xa0We offer several Offset Headsheets to accommodate the location and size of different exhaust systems, including DPF exhausts. \\xa05.5 in., 8 in., and 16.5 in. offsets are available for passenger side, driver side, or dual side exhaust stacks. \\xa0If your stacks extend above the cab, the cab shield can be made to fit in-between them. \\xa0Contact RTE for a Cab Shield Data Form and to determine the best Cab Shield for your needs.      Material & Thickness    Overview  The Headsheet can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for the Headsheet. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a ¼ in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50, but we offer the same choices in thicknesses up to ¼”. \\xa0You can also select AHSS for use on your Standard Post Side Body for even greater strength. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.      Sloped Headsheet Cleanouts    Overview  Installed at the front of the body about 36” above the floor. \\xa0Perfect for sticky materials that tend to clog the front corners with large deposits.            Sidewall Options        Sloped Front to Back       Description  The Sloped Wall feature (sometimes called a “Western” style) is used in situations that require more loading near the cab to assist in weight distribution. \\xa0It can also be used as a permanent substitute for Side Boards. \\xa0In addition to those benefits, it also looks great!      Side Boards       Description  A popular choice when operating at sites using front end loaders or bucket excavators that side load into the dump body. \\xa0When timing is critical, even the best loader operator can inadvertently move the bucket into the side wall, usually right at the top. \\xa0If this happens, wood Side Boards allow for easy replacement. \\xa0RTE uses No.1 \\xa0SYP planks, flame burnished resulting in a fine appearance. \\xa0The Side Boards can be single or double stacked. \\xa0The Board-and-a-half option consists of a sloping top board, giving the usefulness of a Slope Front to Back side wall option combined with the versatility of a removable Side Board. \\xa0When installed, Side Boards provide increased cubic capacity. \\xa0With Side Boards removed, the ease of access is increased and the possibility of capacity overload is reduced.      Mid-Body Board Brackets       Description  When using Side Boards, especially double-stacked boards, a Mid-Body Board Bracket provides additional support for the wood planks. \\xa0Usually these are used when the Side Boards are not expecting to be removed frequently.      Fender/Rub Rail and Top Rail Lights       Description  Make your unit stand out by adding Oval Amber or Strobe, or Round Marker side mounted lights to the lower Fender or main Top Rail of your Side Wall. \\xa0Contact RTE for to determine the best lights and locations for your requirements.      Electric Body Tarp       Description  The Electric Body Tarp is the best way to cover your payload in fast, safe, and reliable manner. \\xa0The in-cab control makes it easy for the operator since no physical labor is required. \\xa0The heavy duty electric motor, assembled in America, retracts the tarp to the open uncovered position. \\xa0The tarp is rolled into cab shield. \\xa0With our Integrated Cab Shield option, the retracted tarp is completely enclosed within the Cab Shield Wind Deflector. \\xa0When the operator is ready to cover the load, a return spring automatically pivots the tarp arms into the closed position. \\xa0There are several choices of tarp systems.    Underbody Spring Mount  Underbody Spring Mount tarp systems are the most popular tarp system. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the fender rub rail at the bottom of the Side Wall. \\xa0It is available for all Standard Post Side Body and Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body styles.    Banjo Spring Mount  Banjo Spring Mount tarp systems are used on special bodies. \\xa0The return spring is mounted beneath the main Top Rail at the top of the Side Wall. \\xa0The Banjo Spring Mount tarp system is not used for most applications, unless recommended by RTE.    Tarp Material  The actual Tarp material is durable and thick, sure to withstand many seasons of use. \\xa0It is available in two material types. \\xa0Mesh Tarps are the most popular tarp material. \\xa0Asphalt Tarps are an option when handling sticky materials that can become attached to the tarp and cause problems when rolling up. \\xa0Additional side and rear flap extensions are available when complete payload coverage is desired.      Body Steps with Handle       Description  The Body Step with Handle is a safe way for an operator to access the inside of the body without crawling under the tailgate or throwing a leg over the Side Wall. \\xa0The Body Steps are located at the front of the body to facilitate immediate access from the cab steps to the body. \\xa0Optional underbody fender Steps make entering directly from the ground possible. \\xa0The Body Steps are corrugated to ensure a non-slip surface and the Handle provides a secure place to firmly grip by hand. \\xa0Inside Body Steps straps make entering the body as easy as ever. \\xa0The Body Steps are normally placed on the driver side, but they can be installed on the passenger side, or both. \\xa0The Handle is available on all bodies that use a Cab Shield. \\xa0The formed handle extends continuously from the bottom of the ladder up past the top rail and towards the front of the body on the cab shield, providing an overhead handle, a unique design element used exclusively by RTE.      Material & Thickness       Description  The Side Wall can be customized with several features to get the most from your body. \\xa0Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body uses 3/16 in. Ultra-High Strength Steel for the Side Wall. \\xa0For heavy duty jobs, we offer a 1/4 in. thick upgrade. \\xa0Or choose thinner 5/32 in. steel for less demanding applications. \\xa0Our Standard Post Side Body uses 10 gauge High Strength Low Alloy Grade 50 and we offer thicknesses from 5/32 \\xa0in. up to 1/4 in. \\xa0For some users, Stainless Steel would be an appropriate material choice. \\xa0Contact RTE for help in choosing the best combination of material and thickness for your needs.            Floor Options        Crossmemberless       Crossmemberless  Our Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body utilizes single pieced formed trapezoidal long sill instead of traditional C-Channel main rails and I-Beam crossmembers. \\xa0The result is a lighter floor assembly that does not form a washboard appearance. \\xa0Fabricated with Ultra-High Strength Steel, the floor is exceptionally durable and a main reason why this body is capable of outlasting many crossmember style units. \\xa0The absence of Channels and Beams reduce places for material to accumulate and rust.      Long Sill Height       Description  RTE is always listening to the needs of our customers and that is what led us to offer two different heights of trapezoidal long sills. \\xa0You may choose from the most popular height of 11 in. or select the 8 in. height to lower the center of gravity and reduce weight. \\xa0Always consider any components that will sit above the frame of the chassis, as lowering the body will reduce clearance. \\xa0Constructed of 3/16” material, which is thicker than 7 gauge steel, RTE long sills are the strongest on the market.      Body Tie-Down Clips       Description  Body Tie-Down Clips are available to provide 4 places to attach the J-Hook on tie-down straps. \\xa0The clips are often used for V-box spreader attachment points. \\xa0They are also useful for body transport. \\xa0The Tie-Downs are welded to the Main Rails or Trapezoidal Long Sills.      Body Vibrator       Description  A Body Vibrator should be considered in applications where material may become stuck to the inside body. \\xa0In order to completely empty the load, the Body Vibrator will shake the floor and dislodge material so that the operator does not need to get out of the cab and break the remaining amount free. \\xa0And more than likely, first the operator will try to use the truck brakes to cause the tailgate to slam the body to loosen the material. \\xa0Besides damaging the tailgate, this is also especially hard on the body hoist, which can be stretched opened beyond the stage stop limits or by creating dangerous pressure spikes in the cylinder tubes. \\xa0By eliminating tailgate slamming, a number of costly repairs are reduced. \\xa0Finally, spreading material while dumping is facilitated by the use of a Body Vibrator.      Asphalt Bolster    Description  With the Asphalt Bolster design, the floor is specifically constructed to work with underframe asphalt pavers and hoppers. \\xa0It will let the tractor pull as far under the body as the chassis frame or tires will allow. \\xa0The angled bolster clears the paver when the body is raised delivering asphalt into the hopper. \\xa0Then when the load is delivered, the dump body can immediately pull away without the need to wait for the body to lower to get paver clearance, increasing the number of daily runs. \\xa0Since there is no asphalt spreader, there is no place for excess material to accumulate. \\xa0The position of the tailgate latch keeps it clear of material during discharge.      Heated Floor    Description  The Heated Floor option can be added to the Crossmemberless Smooth Side Body line. \\xa0The Heated Floor provides a continuous heating source for materials that need to remain at elevated temperatures, such as asphalt. \\xa0By efficiently utilizing the existing exhaust system, the Heated Floor is an economical way to benefit your job performance by speeding material discharge performance, since warm material flows uniformly. \\xa0For the benefit of the road crew, the consistent material temperature upon delivery simplifies asphalt placement, rates, and grading and sloping distribution.      Spread Apron    Description  Spread Aprons provide a way to establish just the right overhang for your chassis and application. \\xa0They also improve dumping accuracy. \\xa0Many options are available for our Spread Aprons. \\xa0We offer 6”, 8”, 10”, and 12” lengths. \\xa0Choose from fixed welded or removable spread aprons. \\xa0We offer bolt-on removable and pin-on removable choices.            Hoist Options        Telescopic Cylinder       Description  RTE uses Telescopic hoists for body lengths over 11 ft. \\xa0With bore diameters ranging from 6 in. to 8 in., the size of the hoist is matched to the application, so you will never be underpowered or over-specified. \\xa0Typical dump angles will be 50 degrees, giving plenty of slope to slide out the most stubborn loads. \\xa0RTE works with several hoist manufacturers to offer the widest available selection and will be happy to find the right cylinder for you.      Underbody & Telescopic Sub-Frame Hoists       Description  Some smaller units require the use of a sub-frame to mount a hoist to the chassis and body. \\xa0RTE offers both Underbody Hoists and Telescopic Hoists mounted into sub-frames. \\xa0For our Standard Post Side body, an Underbody Hoist is the cost effective solution for raising your body. \\xa0The Underbody Hoist is one of the most durable on the market. \\xa0If you are using a body from the LTWT line, RTE offers a suitably matched lightweight Underbody Hoist. \\xa0When weight is a consideration, you do not want to carry unneeded heft. \\xa0All Sub-Frame Hoists feature simple installation to get you onto the job site right away. \\xa0Simply fasten the sub-frame to the chassis frame, hook up the hydraulics and electrics, and go to work!      Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder       Description  The Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinder was popularized in Europe and Canada, but the American made RTE bodies have brought the option to the rest of us. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Telescopic Cylinders allow for a smaller Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” inside the body, which increases the cubic capacity of the body. \\xa0RTE uses Custom Hoist, Hyva, or Mailhot cylinders.      Hoist Basket       Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of hoist baskets for both traditional standard Telescopic Cylinders and for Trunnion Mount Cylinders. \\xa0The standard Hoist Basket holds the Oil Tank and Telescopic Hoist. \\xa0It fits directly into the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House” for a protective shield when the body is being loaded. \\xa0Trunnion Mount Cylinders have the option to partially extend past the front of the body or be completely covered by the floor.      Oil Tank    Description  RTE manufactures its complete line of Oil Tanks for all the various hoist and cylinder options. \\xa0Every single Oil Tank is pressure tested to ensure leak proof operation. \\xa0Our Oil Tanks are designed specifically for the RTE line of bodies, but will fit many other applications. \\xa0Our Pyramid Oil Tank is fastened to the Hoist Basket and fits comfortably inside the Hoist Tunnel “Dog House”. \\xa0The Pyramid Oil Tanks are available in 10, 30, and 35 gallon volumes. \\xa0Rectangular Side Mount Tanks are attached to the chassis side frame or can be positioned inside chassis frame rails on trucks that have limited space. \\xa0They are ideal for use with sub-frame hoists. \\xa0The available sizes are 5, 8.5, 15, and 30 gallons. \\xa0The Flat Oil Tanks are slim reservoirs that fit between the back of the cab and the front of the body. \\xa0They are available in 20 and 50 gallon sizes. \\xa0The tall design also increases the pump oil supply head pressure. \\xa0Add an optional Hydraulic Fluid Sight Gauge to any of our Oil Tanks to make checking the oil level as easy as taking a quick glance. \\xa0Available in standard carbon steel or stainless steel.

And since Stainless Steel won’t rust, the body will not require paint and will look great for years. Municipalities and Highway Departments often use these bodies, but they are also great for contractor and landscape use where durability is important. Body Lengths from 9 ft to 13 ft are typical with Wall Heights from 14 inch to 36 inch. We also offer some larger sized units. Most standard options are available on the Stainless Steel body line so you have the ability to tailor the unit to your requirements. In operation continuously under one family since the 1920’s, Rowe Truck Equipment’s experience will ensure you get the right body for your specific needs.
