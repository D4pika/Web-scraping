The product family consists of three models designated TB045, TB065 and TB113 that each feature a high-ratio double planetary gear set, with reduction ratios from 42:1 to 103:1 and an output torque capacity from 45,000 Nm to 113,000 Nm.  Designed for the unit\u2019s injector head assembly, these drives allow tubing to be pulled or pushed into the injector head, which is critical to successfully operating in rigorous conditions. The drives deliver maximum pull capacities from 80,000 to 140,000 lbf (356 to 623 kN), and their low profile and high output to weight design helps manufacturers meet road weight limiting conditions. Another unique feature of the gearbox is a design which lowers internal friction, allowing the gearbox to run cooler and quieter in long duty cycles.  \u201cWe are excited to offer oil and gas OEMs a comprehensive range of lightweight, high capacity injector drives that are configurable for a variety of customized needs, including male or female input options to accommodate electric or hydraulic motors,\u201d says Robert Kress, Oerlikon Fairfield\u2019s oil and gas business development manager. \u201cDesigned for rugged reliability and reduced maintenance, our Torque-Hub\u00ae injector drives complement our existing line of drives for wireline, slickline and reel drives in the support of all types of well service and workover operations.\u201d  Back to overview      Share this on:   Facebook  Google+  Twitter  LinkedIn       Did you know?

February 09, 2017  print   The Nordschleife, the old North Loop of the N\u00fcrburg-Ring auto racing complex in Germany, has enjoyed a brutal reputation from its opening. One journalist, after watching the first race in 1927, described the winding steep grades and tight corners through the Eifel forests as something that could have been designed by a \u201creeling, drunken giant.\u201d In its 33rd year, three-time world champion driver Jackie Stewart bestowed the track\u2019s enduring nickname: Green Hell.   https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OE_Porsche_V1_FINAL.mp4  Even with modifications over the years to improve safety \u2014 in 1970, Formula 1 drivers boycotted the course because it was so dangerous \u2014 the Nordschleife remains a challenge. The 73 turns and 300 meters (1,000 feet) of elevation change over a length of 20.8 km (12.9 miles) test the endurance, skill, and nerve of drivers \u2026 and the mettle of the metal they drive.  Unlike many race courses, the Nordschleife is actually a toll road that is open to the public, so you could take your car out for a spin. \u201cBut if you\u2019re in the typical consumer auto, you probably won\u2019t match the course record for a sedan of 7 minutes and 38 seconds that the new Porsche Panamera Turbo recently set,\u201d commented Dr.-Ing. Thomas G\u00fcnther, Director Development V-Engines, Porsche AG. The time is even more impressive when you realize that the track record set by the Porsche 918 Spyder, technically the most sophisticated sports car of all time, was 6 minutes and 57 seconds.  The Panamera combines extraordinary performance with incredible efficiency. Its modular 4-litre V8 engine drives between 5,750 and 6,000 rpm and top power of 550 hp. The acceleration propels you from 0 to 100km/h, or roughly 62 mph, in 3.8 seconds. That approaches the kick of a fast street-legal production motorcycle.  And yet, for all the power, fuel efficiency is important as well. The new adaptive cylinder control system effectively, and unperceptively to the driver, switches between 8-cylinder and 4-cylinder modes, depending on power demand. The latter mode improves fuel efficiency by up to 30 percent. The aluminum engine takes up to 9.5 kilograms (20.9 pounds) off the previous engine weights.  A less obvious but vital part of gaining efficiency, and increased power, is the use of a steel coating on the interior of the cylinders. The weight improvement of aluminum crankcases is achieved without sacrificing the valued robustness of iron-based cylinder bores. Aluminum is soft compared to steel. The unrelenting movement and stress of the pistons can wear down the cylinders and shorten their life. The right coating is a thin layer of metal that bonds to the cylinder surface, providing characteristics that aluminum alone doesn\u2019t possess.  Porsche has already been using thermal spray coatings (APS), in which hot, ionized gases are used to melt metal-based powders and propel them onto the surface of the inside wall of a cylinder to create a coating. The current material composition of the steel coating, about the thickness of a sheet of copy paper, cuts wear by upward of 10 percent compared to the materials of the raceway surfaces used in previous generations of engines. Oil consumption is also down by up to half compared to previous versions of the engine. So, not only is the car powerful, but it has respect for the environment as well.  The coating that helps the Panamera attain its outstanding characteristics uses SUMEBore technology from the Oerlikon Metco brand. For over 20 years, Oerlikon Metco has helped automobile and truck manufacturers improve performance of their engines while cutting weight, improving fuel efficiency, reducing wear, corrosion and CO 2 emissions. And, of course, create a driving experience just this side of being in a Formula 1 race car.

Oerlikon Metco utilizes modern computer technology in a revolutionary way to usher in a new age of materials.\u00a0Today we possess the most advanced software and experimental approaches for developing new materials and alloys as we continuously push the science of alloy development forward.\r\n\r\nOerlikon Metco's unique and patented Scoperta\u2122 computational alloy development process is a powerful analytical tool that we use to quickly create revolutionary, optimized alloy products for our customers.   Our Scoperta process allows us to develop real material solutions for industrial applications. We use powerful 'big data' analytical software to design new materials, and we are experts in translating this science into products that benefit our customers with unique advantages:   Rapid alloy development: These tools allow us to develop new solutions in a matter of months instead of years. This means we can create and commercialize products much faster, thereby getting our customers the materials they need for their applications far faster than through conventional empirical material development methods.   Revolutionary material compositions: Our ground-breaking approach allows us to create materials with very unique service characteristics that solve application issues that conventional alloy development process cannot. As such, we can provide answers to surface challenges that were only dreamed of previously.   Specially designed for surface technology: While a bulk alloy may have exactly the right wear, corrosion or other characteristics desired, these bulk properties often do not translate completely when the same alloy composition is used as a surface solution. By using our Scoperta process we can develop new or modified compositions that will not disappoint.   Examples of these new materials developments are\u00a0Metco 8224 and Metco 1030A. New iron-based\u00a0alloys that have\u00a0performance metrics similar to tungsten carbide. These\u00a0alloys precipitate\u00a0fine scale carbides during the welding process that create a super abrasion-resistant microstructure with significant impact resistance. Metco 8250 and Metco 1040A are\u00a0austenitic manganese steels that, as welded, have\u00a0a hardness of HRC\u00a045 to 50 \u00a0- significantly higher than conventional manganese steel materials. After impact/wear, it will harden to HRC\u00a063. These new materials have seen significant traction in the mining and agriculture market sectors for Ground Engaging Tools (GET), Crushing Applications, Wear Plates and Cutting Tools.  When we combine this unique capability with our decades of surface processing expertise and our exceptional flexibility for alloy manufacturing, it is clear that Oerlikon Metco is a 'Materials Powerhouse' designed for the benefit of our customers.

Hecht</em></p>\n<p>Many of us fantasize about living in the future. But at Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Hitachi Tool Engineering, Ltd., Kazuyuki Kubota, Head of Manufacturing Department and Head of Coating Technology, <em>actually</em> works in the future. This isn\u2019t science fiction. He hasn\u2019t mastered the art of time travel. But when it comes to coating systems and technology, Kubota never stops anticipating the next breakthrough in requirements, capabilities and performance.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2284\" style=\"max-width: 1410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2284 size-full\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beitragsbild2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beitragsbild2.jpg 1400w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beitragsbild2-890x465.jpg 890w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beitragsbild2-768x401.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unstoppable innovator: Kazuyuki Kubota from Mitsubishi Hitachi Tool Engineering.</p></div>\n<p>This makes partnering with him something like playing with a chess master whose mind is always working three moves ahead. Some companies might find that intimidating. But the team at Oerlikon Balzers finds it inspiring. Yes, it\u2019s rewarding to bring products to market that \u201cmeet or exceed\u201d customers\u2019 expectations. But it\u2019s more interesting when each product launch motivates the customer to envision the next stage of expectations and performance standards.</p>\n<p>To put it another way: the pace of change is so rapid these days that it\u2019s no longer possible to use state of the art technology \u2014 only technology that\u2019s state of the art <em>for now</em>. Each advance establishes the foundation for the next one. And customers like Kubota drive the Oerlikon Balzers team to work continuously on being first to market with what\u2019s next.</p>\n<h4>Exacting standards, clear-cut results</h4>\n<p>The right coating can improve a tool\u2019s precision, resistance to friction and abrasion, and durability. It can also strengthen a company\u2019s reputation. For decades, Mitsubishi Hitachi Tool Engineering has relied on coatings to optimize the performance of its machinery and forming tools as well as its leadership position.</p>\n<p>The company, which manufactures and sells tips along with cutting and forming tools made of special steels or carbide alloys, has an obligation to its own customers and a commitment to growing with them. Each new generation of tools employs the latest coating technology to ensure that the company retains its competitive edge in this market. It has collaborated with Oerlikon Balzers for more than 30 years in pursuit of these goals.</p>\n<p>More than a decade ago, during development of the new Arc technology, Oerlikon Balzers introduced the INNOVA system, which enabled Kubota\u2019s team to reduce the time required to develop and manufacture many new coatings and products. Most recently, Mitsubishi Hitachi purchased the latest advance, INLENIA, a line of coating systems that Oerlikon Balzers designed for ultra-smooth surfaces. The solution attracted Kubota\u2019s interest because of benefits such as making customization possible thanks to the precise, independent scalability of pulse duration, shape, and density. This represents a significant advance beyond conventional HiPIMS (high-power impulse magnetron sputtering).</p>\n<p>\u201cHiPIMS is useful for products that require low particle coating, which is one of the features and advantages of this technology,\u201d Kubota says. \u201cTo expand our business within these product lines, we are considering installing additional systems. We want to use this system as the foundation of further research and development.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2283\" style=\"max-width: 986px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2283 size-large\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-976x801.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"976\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-976x801.jpg 976w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-609x500.jpg 609w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-768x631.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-1096x900.jpg 1096w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kazuyuki Kubota and Wolfgang Kalss, Head of Marketing &amp; Product Management Tools from Oerlikon Balzers in front of an INLENIA kila.</p></div>\n<h4>Tomorrow\u2019s challenges, in focus today</h4>\n<p>But his longtime partners at Oerlikon Balzers knew that even as Mitsubishi Hitachi put the INLENIA system\u2019s potential to work, Kubota would be thinking about further advances in the technology. He continues to monitor emerging coating system developments and is already considering where to make future investments in those next-generation systems.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to develop new coatings with special compositions that are beyond the range of the conventional nitride coating in the existing market,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, we also consider that another technology is necessary to make these new coatings act properly and functionally on the cutting tools, as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>PVD (physical vapor deposition) technology is another area where there is \u201croom to progress and be improved,\u201d he says. \u201cApplying HiPIMS technologies to our products is just starting point of this progress. By using this technology, we can generate additional hints and ideas for future technologies. Our collaborative work and relationship with Oerlikon Balzers supports our search for such a new technology.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a search that shows no sign of ending \u2014 because every time these partners achieve an objective, they ask themselves what new challenge they can take on. Of course, the engineers at Oerlikon Balzers have an internal drive to build on their record of breakthroughs. But there\u2019s something empowering and inspiring about having a customer who\u2019s always wondering what can be done to improve current products and solutions. It is through collaboration with clients such as Kazuyuki Kubota and his team at Mitsubishi Hitachi Tool Engineering that Oerlikon Balzers optimizes its capacity for exploring each successive advance in coating systems and exploiting the full potential of these technologies. And that\u2019s what \u201cworking in the future\u201d is all about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/balzers/com/en/portfolio/equipment/inlenia/\">Find out more about the coating systems INLENIA kila and INLENIA pica!</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/07/12/30-years-of-whats-next/\">30 years of \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/07/12/30-years-of-whats-next/feed/  0     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/06/27/this-type-of-textile-affects-virtually-every-area-of-your-life/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/06/27/this-type-of-textile-affects-virtually-every-area-of-your-life/#comments  Wed, 27 Jun 2018 11:37:18 +0000  Oerlikon  Urbanization  Manmade fibers  Oerlikon Neumag  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2266  <p>Exploring the many ways nonwovens make our lives better.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/06/27/this-type-of-textile-affects-virtually-every-area-of-your-life/\">This type of textile affects virtually every area of your life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><strong><em>Nonwoven materials typically have a low profile, but their impact on making lives better can&#8217;t be overstated.

Manufactured in engineered sheets or webs of intermingled fibers, the fabric is treated mechanically, thermally or chemically to instill various properties like absorption, flexibility or strength. The result is a wide range of materials that have become critical improvements to many important industries.</p>\n<p><strong>Safer medicine:</strong> Virtually the entire medical industry relies on nonwoven fabrics to make medical treatment and procedures safer and more sterile. From masks, gloves and surgical scrub suits to isolation gowns and porous medical packaging that allows gas sterilization, nonwovens are essential in maintaining sanitary medical environments and practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Better personal hygiene:</strong> Convenient, easy to use, and disposable, nonwovens help consumers address a variety of personal needs. Baby and adult wipes, makeup removal towelettes, feminine hygiene products, and diapers are all made from nonwoven materials. These fabrics are also used to make household wipes, which help keep surfaces clean and disinfected.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainable, durable infrastructure: </strong>The International Geosynthetics Society says that up to half of current carbon dioxide emissions in the world today are related to infrastructure development, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nonwovens-industry.com/issues/2017-04-01/view_features/a-growing-exhibition-reflects-nonwovens-industry-t-154653/\">Nonwoven Industry report</a>.</p>\n<p>Nonwovens are reducing the sector&#8217;s carbon footprint while playing a key role in reducing pollution, erosion, and other development impact. These textiles are being used for roadway underlayment to build more durable roads, landfill liners to help prevent toxins from leaching into soil and water, erosion control barriers to prevent soil erosion, and many other applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Home improvements:</strong> Their comfort, light weight, versatility and durability make nonwoven materials a staple in the home. Nonwovens are used to make weather-resistant home wraps and insulation that make home heating and cooling more energy-saving. They are also used in pillows, mattress cores, cushions, and acoustic insulation for appliances and wall paneling, making homes more quiet and comfortable.</p>\n<p><strong>Leisurely indulgences:</strong> Whether you like to spend your time off pursuing outdoor activities, doing a little shopping, or savoring a hot cup of coffee, nonwovens touch your life. Marine sails, tent materials, shopping bags, and even coffee filters and tea bags are all made from nonwoven textiles.</p>\n<h4>Better Lives through Better Products</h4>\n<p>\u201cAs consumers become more demanding and products must improve to remain competitive, the manufacturing technology behind these materials needs to change, as well,\u201d says Ingo M\u00e4hlmann, vice president, Oerlikon Nonwoven. The nonwoven technology team at Oerlikon focuses on developing innovative manufacturing processes that improve textile durability and functionality while maintaining sustainable production standards. Some of these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nonwoven meltblown technology provides extremely high industrial wipe production capacity without sacrificing quality.</li>\n<li>The joint venture with Teknoweb Materials (TKWM) / Italy offers hybrid technology lines to manufacture high quality wipe nonwovens for a wide variety of end-uses. The technology dispenses with hydro entanglement and subsequent drying resulting in energy and cost savings for customers. The newly-created, combined technology offers considerable synergy potential and the ideal pre-requisites for launching innovative products.</li>\n<li>A new multi-functional forming table for meltblown nonwoven production allows customers to produce various types of meltblown nonwoven textiles with just one production line, enabling customers to develop their own innovative products and differentiate themselves within their markets.</li>\n<li>For the efficient production of needlepunched spunbond nonwovens for geotextile purposes, Oerlikon developed an efficient and disruptive new process. The company will be the first to offer this technology to the marketplace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The near future is dedicated to simplify the Oerlikon Nonwoven processes by automation,&#8221; M\u00e4hlmann says. &#8220;This is why Oerlikon\u2019s nonwoven business is focusing on intelligent automation and industry 4.0 developments implementing sensors and actor.&#8221; As smart machines and innovative new manufacturing approaches continue to evolve, so will the applications and possibilities for nonwovens in even more areas of life.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/06/27/this-type-of-textile-affects-virtually-every-area-of-your-life/\">This type of textile affects virtually every area of your life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/06/27/this-type-of-textile-affects-virtually-every-area-of-your-life/feed/  2     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/#comments  Fri, 04 May 2018 13:59:50 +0000  Oerlikon  Automotive  Manmade fibers  Oerlikon Barmag  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2233  <p>The Hidden Fibers that Keep You Safer on the Road</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/\">Do you know what&#8217;s in your tires?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><strong><em>While many don&#8217;t give much thought to tire yarns, relentless process improvement and exceptional machinery are delivering safer, more durable, and lighter-weight options for partners and consumers.</em></strong></p>\n<div class=\"tire-map\">\n    <img src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/background.jpg\" alt=\"Tire\" class=\"view\" />\n    <img src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/indicators.png\" alt=\"\" usemap=\"#imgmap20180504\" class=\"indicators\" />\n    <map id=\"imgmap20180504\" name=\"imgmap20180504\">\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"25,25,668,204\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/hidden-fibers.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"330,217,836,445\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/giraffe.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"624,481,839,991\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/lego.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"1,996,661,1218\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/dollar.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"12,625,567,977\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/tireyarn.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"12,218,325,584\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/bicycle.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n    </map>\n</div>\n<p><em>By Gwen Moran</em></p>\n<p>Many people think of tires as being made from durable slabs of synthetic material. However, they don&#8217;t realize that material is made from many high modulus, low shrinkage (HMLS) yarns that are manufactured into the familiar forms that moves our vehicles along the world&#8217;s highways, roads, and other surfaces and terrain.</p>\n<h4>Championship League</h4>\n<p>However, creating these versatile, durable industrial fibers is no easy feat. Tire manufacturers demand increasingly more durable materials that maintain their stability in extreme temperatures and in rigorous use. Doing so requires innovation at every level of the manufacturing process\u2014especially in tire cord production.</p>\n<p>The high temperatures and fast speeds at which polymer materials need to be melted and spun require specialized, high-performance machinery to deliver fibers that are sufficiently tear-resistant, but elastic and temperature as well as dimensionally stable. The higher the spinning and winding speeds, the more sensitive the filaments respond to even the slightest irregularities in polymer melt, possibly resulting in breakage that can affect quality. Oerlikon Barmag is one of just two companies worldwide that deliver machine solutions for the production of HMLS yarn.</p>\n<p>&#8220;HMLS yarn machines are &#8216;champion\u2019s league&#8217; among industrial yarn machines,&#8221; says Markus Reichwein, Oerlikon Barmag&#8217;s Head of Product Management. The machinery components must remain stable under punishing conditions. In addition, process engineers must continuously optimize the spinning process from melt to yarn to meet customers&#8217; high expectations.</p>\n<h4>Improved Performance</h4>\n<p>As a result, Oerlikon&#8217;s machines are able to achieve the world&#8217;s fastest spinning process with speeds of around 6300m/min and temperatures reaching as high as 260\u00b0C. In addition, the team intensively reviews product performance at every stage of the tire cord manufacture\u2014including, twisting, weaving and dipping\u2014to ensure that the final treated fabric meets rigorous standards and to identify possible process and machine improvements, adds Roy Dolmans, Team Leader of Industrial Yarn Process at Oerlikon Barmag.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With our latest developments it is possible to process higher polymer viscosities at lower temperatures,&#8221; Dolmans says. The result is a moderate treatment that produces a thicker polymer melt, improving the material&#8217;s tenacity and stability. In other words, tougher materials from which to make tires.</p>\n<h4>Sustainable Innovation</h4>\n<p>Just as constant innovation leads to improvements in manufacturing processes and outcomes, it also has an impact on sustainability. Customers want to know that their manufacturing partners have environmentally sound practices. Oerlikon&#8217;s EvoQuench manufacturing process reduces the air volume necessary to solidify molten filaments. In addition, the use of high-frequency heating coils inside some components lead to less energy loss while heating the yarn faster and more precisely than conventional heating technology.</p>\n<p>As the market shifts, both Dolmans and Reichwein say that there is a strong push for process automation to minimize labor costs, improve efficiency, and increase yarn quality. Tire manufacturers are looking for more durable fabrics that can manage the same load at a lower weight. Through process improvement and digitization, companies like Oerlikon Barmag have greater methods of handling, visualizing and analyzing data to improve efficiency and save money while delivering on customer expectations.</p>\n<p>Achieving those varied facets of improvement &#8220;requires not only a very high competency and accuracy in designing and manufacturing the machines, it also requires deep HMLS process know how to exactly define the correct hardware specification as well as also the required process settings,&#8221; Reichwein says. When achieved, it is the consumer who ultimately benefits from an affordable, exceptional product, sustainably produced.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/\">Do you know what&#8217;s in your tires?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/feed/  2     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/04/20/innovation-is-in-our-dna/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/04/20/innovation-is-in-our-dna/#comments  Fri, 20 Apr 2018 08:07:34 +0000  Oerlikon  Additive manufacturing  Aerospace  Automotive  Oerlikon Balzers  Oerlikon Barmag  Oerlikon Graziano  Oerlikon Metco  Oerlikon Neumag  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2206  <p>Disruptive technologies and solutions at the 2018 Oerlikon Innovation Day</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/04/20/innovation-is-in-our-dna/\">\u201cInnovation is in our DNA\u201d</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><em><strong>100 investors, customers and representatives of the media and universities met in Lucerne for Oerlikon\u2019s first Innovation Day.</strong></em></p>\n<p>New technologies are constantly changing our markets.

The legendary gas turbine plant at Huttenstra\u00dfe. Ayhan Cetin walks through the final assembly hall. In the middle of the hall, an order is being completed for an SGT5-4000F turbine. In a few weeks\u2019 time, this mighty, high-performance machine will be shipped from nearby Westhafen to the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Research engineer Cetin now walks up the stairs to a gallery. From here, we see an area at the rear of the hall surrounded by white sound barriers. This is the gas turbine test bed. This, says Cetin, is where current products and new technologies are \u201cput through their paces.\u201d Several thousand measuring points provide information about performance, efficiency, effectiveness, emission levels and much more. Outsiders can only guess at what goes on behind these sound barriers. What we learn from Cetin is that the facility\u2019s water brake plays a vital role.</p>\n<h4><strong>Extreme pressure creates challenges</strong></h4>\n<p>The water brake consists of a steel case that contains a rotor comprising multiple wheel discs. The material: a low-alloy steel. Cetin can talk about the water brake for hours, although his explanations are more suited to the experts \u2013 just as when he waxes lyrical about the theory of boundary layer friction in turbulent flow. Put simply, high shear and friction forces cause thermal energy to be produced and extracted from the heat transfer medium (water). Depending on the regulatable flow rate and the effective frictional surface, a torque is created that works against the gas turbine that\u2019s being tested and thus absorbs the energy produced.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Cetin was appointed system supervisor of the water brake system at the Berlin gas turbine test bed, the largest of its kind in the world. The challenges associated with a facility of this size are huge. The water brake, in particular, is subject to extreme stress and must be inspected constantly to ensure uninterrupted operation. Cetin is therefore all the more delighted to have recently succeeded in optimizing the water brake in collaboration with Oerlikon Balzers. This involved making the wheel discs more hard-wearing. The process: plasma nitriding. The product: BALITHERM\u00ae IONIT. The result: longer inspection intervals. But let\u2019s go back to the beginning.</p>\n<p>Siemens AG is one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the field of power generation, and gas and steam turbines form the core business of the technology group. To define its portfolio, it is testing prototypes of new products and technologies. Development times and costs are deciding factors when it comes to the profitability of any company, and the high availability of the gas turbine test bay is therefore essential for Siemens PG.</p>\n<p>In a conventional gas turbine power plant, the energy created is absorbed by the generator. In the Berlin gas turbine test bed, however, this is not the case. Here, no continuous power generation can be guaranteed, and thus it cannot be fed into the grid. The mechanical output of the gas turbine is therefore converted into waste heat via the water brake, which in effect replaces the generator and absorbs the energy produced.</p>\n<h4><strong>What can protect against corrosion and cavitation?</strong></h4>\n<p>The Berlin gas turbine test bed was built in 1972, with the water brake following in 1975. Over the decades, however, the demands placed on the facility increased constantly. While 100 megawatts were originally marked as the maximum total output for the test bay, this has since increased to 360 megawatts. Nowhere else in the world other than at Siemens in Berlin are these values achieved.</p>\n<p>For a long time, the greatest challenge was presented by the functionality of the wheel discs of the water brake. The wheel discs\u2019 material is susceptible to corrosion, which is triggered as soon as contact with moisture occurs. Rust, for its part, results in the creation of cavitation, which can significantly damage the wheel discs. Cetin mentions centrifugal and coriolis forces and talks about tremendous turbulence in the system. \u201cIn many cases,\u201d he says, \u201ccavitation is caused as a result of high flow rates. As the rate increases, the static pressure of the liquid falls. If it falls to below vapor pressure, vapor bubbles are formed that are carried along in the flow and can suddenly implode. This results in the formation of microjets that cause material damage with their high speed and extreme pressure load.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cavitation leads to vibration problems, imbalances that can impair the function of the water brake. Should several wheel discs fail, for example, the brake can no longer be operated, and the gas turbine test bed is out of action. While the discs can be mechanically reworked or exchanged if necessary, this would result in frequent inspections and high maintenance costs. There were times, says Cetin, when the wheel discs were unusable after relatively few hours of operation.</p>\n<h4><strong>Siemens and Oerlikon: Solving it hand-in-hand</strong></h4>\n<p>The preliminary discussions between Siemens PG and Oerlikon were held in autumn 2014. Oerlikon Balzers\u2019 Martin Fromme says: \u201cThe economic objective was to significantly increase the lifespan of the wheels.\u201d The first tests and basic analysis were carried out at the Clausthal University of Technology in 2015, and the first samples were prepared in 2016. Plasma nitriding with BALITHERM IONIT involves diffusing nitrogen 0.2 millimeters into the steel. In the test phase, the nitrided brake discs showed no corrosion or cavitation after 25% more hours of operation. \u201cThe discs looked almost the same as they did on the first day,\u201d says Cetin. The first series went into production at the beginning of 2017.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2181\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-1069x801.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1069\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-1069x801.jpg 1069w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-667x500.jpg 667w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-1201x900.jpg 1201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1069px) 100vw, 1069px\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>We couldn\u2019t ask for more</strong></h4>\n<p>Now, nine months later, Ayhan Cetin still has no cause for complaint. On the contrary. Recently, a gas turbine was tested at 50 hertz. The result: no cavitation, not even any corrosion. \u201cHowever,\u201d says Cetin, \u201cwe have not yet reached the wear limit. I believe that in the future we can even aim to increase the lifespan of the wheel discs by two or three times, ideally even more.\u201d Cetin is also confident about the turbine currently in the test bed: \u201cI do not anticipate any significant maintenance, or that the brake discs will need to be replaced.\u201d So, does this mean that everything ran smoothly with the collaboration between Siemens PG and Oerlikon? \u201cWe are able to save time and money, and to improve the performance of the test bay,\u201d says Cetin. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ask for more.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>AYHAN CETIN</strong>, born 1977, studied mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Berlin, where he specialized in design technology. He joined the company in January 2008 and has been responsible for the water brake in the gas turbine test bed since 2010.</p>\n<h4><strong>A GERMAN INDUSTRIAL MONUMENT</strong></h4>\n<p>The factory in the Moabit area of Berlin, in particular the gas turbine hall that was completed in 1909, is an internationally renowned monument of industrial architecture. The leading architect Peter Behrens was commissioned to give the building an aesthetic and unmistakable appearance without concealing its industrial significance. The result was one of clear elegance, despite the vastness of the building. It is also extremely rare for a factory building to have served its original purpose for over 100 years. The 1 000th gas turbine was produced in 2016.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/23/running-smoothly/\">Running smoothly</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/23/running-smoothly/feed/  2     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/#comments  Wed, 07 Mar 2018 14:06:48 +0000  Oerlikon  Mobility  Automotive  E-mobility  Gearbox  Oerlikon Graziano  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2164  <p>Why are short-range electric trucks so much more energy efficient than long-range?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/\">Trucking Goes Green</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><strong><em>Tesla made a big splash with the announcement of its Semi electric truck with a planned top 800 km (500 mile) range.

One way to cut the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change is to make trucks electric.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk recently announced Tesla&#8217;s first electric truck, the Semi, but the move had already started. Traditional manufacturers, including Daimler, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Cummins, and startups have been pushing to introduce their own electric trucks.</p>\n<p>E-mobility in commercial transport may sound futuristic, but it&#8217;s already mainstream. Logistics and transport companies DHL and Ryder in the U.S., Titanium Transportation Group in Canada, and Italy&#8217;s Fercam have all placed small initial orders of the Tesla Semi, when it eventually ships. The more trucks can be converted from fossil fuels to electric, the better the environment (assuming the constant growth of renewable sources) \u2014 and, potentially, the cheaper the cost of transportation because of enormous energy savings.</p>\n<p>First attempts to hybridize trucks\u2019 powertrains already demonstrated their potential. Long-distance hauling could reduce overall energy use by 2 percent to 4 percent. Short-distance transport, with a higher amount of braking that can be used to recharge batteries, can achieve between 15 percent and 25 percent savings. As for passenger cars, the ambition is to achieve a full powertrain electrification.</p>\n<p>However, big challenges remain to the further development of electric trucks. One model of the Tesla Semi will have an 800 km (500 mile) range. &#8220;Referring to the official Tesla figures, this would mean a consumption of about 125 kilowatt-hours per 100 kilometers,&#8221; says David Gagliardi, Director, Business Development Automotive and Global Hybrids and E-Drives of Oerlikon Graziano.</p>\n<p>The problem is storing the electricity in the truck. For the Tesla Semi, the required battery would be massive. &#8220;If you get one battery with 1,000 kWh, it is like having ten times the batteries of a Tesla S100,&#8221; Gagliardi says. That would be a 7.5 tonnes (16,500 lbs.) battery: nearly 20 percent of the weight capacity of the largest EU trucks.</p>\n<p>Charging batteries, particularly long-distance trucking, is also tricky. Transport companies would need a web of charging stations \u2014 the electrical equivalent of diesel truck stops.</p>\n<p>Musk has said that he wanted the trucks to charge 80 percent of their battery capacity in half an hour. &#8220;It means a power of 1.6 megawatts in the charging station,&#8221; Gagliardi says. That would be like having a small power station instead of a diesel pump. &#8220;There is no infrastructure in the world currently able to sustain this type of power demand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Such problems can and will be addressed over time, and possibly faster than anyone thinks. A decade ago, experts predicted that a kilowatt-hour of power storage in a battery would drop to $250 by 2020. But innovation made the estimate obsolete. &#8220;There are companies already buying batteries for $150 per kilowatt-hour,&#8221; Gagliardi says.</p>\n<p>One design task facing manufacturers is the gearing and drive train necessary to power an electric truck. The working principles are the same as those of an electric passenger car, but trucks need far more mechanical power to move their loads.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can either increase the electric motor torque or increase its speed for more power,&#8221; Gagliardi says. Increasing speed is cheaper than increasing the torque, which requires longer vehicles. Higher speeds, though, bring other considerations, like high-pitched motor noise and stringent design considerations for gear boxes. However, gear and drive train design companies like Oerlikon Graziano are finding new ways to meet those challenges.</p>\n<p>Oerlikon Graziano has 20 years of experience in developing e-mobility vehicles, from the first golf/utility transaxle to contemporary transfer cases that enable light commercial vehicles, including zero-emission city cars.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/\">Trucking Goes Green</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/feed/  2     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/02/15/were-talking-about-using-materials-and-creating-materials-in-a-whole-new-way/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/02/15/were-talking-about-using-materials-and-creating-materials-in-a-whole-new-way/#respond  Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:31:51 +0000  Oerlikon  Urbanization  Additive manufacturing  MTC  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2141  <p>Interview with TV journalist Melinda Crane on AM\u2019s news-making potential.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/02/15/were-talking-about-using-materials-and-creating-materials-in-a-whole-new-way/\">\u201cWe\u2019re talking about using materials and creating materials in a whole new way.\u201d</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><em>After moderating the 1st Munich Technology Conference, journalist Melinda Crane discusses additive manufacturing\u2019s news-making potential.</em></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2142\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon MTC\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1.jpg 3000w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1-1202x801.jpg 1202w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1-1350x900.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /></p>\n<p><em>By Randy B. Hecht</em></p>\n<p>When Melinda Crane was invited to moderate the 1<sup>st</sup> Munich Technology Conference (MTC), she had only a \u201cgeneral layman\u2019s knowledge\u201d of the process she knew as 3D printing. As a journalist, she quickly came to appreciate Additive Manufacturing (AM) for both its capacity to reinvent manufacturing and for its news potential.</p>\n<p>\u201cI came back from the conference with a sense of having had revealed to me an entire new field,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>The scale of AM\u2019s current and projected capabilities in, for example, producing automobile and airplane parts was just the beginning of what Crane found noteworthy. Equally impressive in her view was \u201cthe fact that we\u2019re talking about using materials and creating materials in a whole new way. That has profound implications for every phase of the value chain.\u201d</p>\n<p>The certification and quality control implications also caught her attention and ranked among the most interesting discoveries she made at the conference. \u201cWe\u2019re talking in some cases about materials with entirely new properties,\u201d she says. \u201cI find that absolutely fascinating. You could say we stand at the threshold of truly a whole new era that will revolutionize applied materials science.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a background in both law and economics, Crane naturally gravitates toward topics that feature interdisciplinary elements, and here, again, AM did not disappoint. She describes herself as fascinated by the way \u201cthis pushes the boundaries between sectors and between academic disciplines\u201d and by \u201chow we get a systemic approach that may be a challenge for some of us coming from the old world of manufacturing.\u201d</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2143 size-full\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon MTC\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M.jpg 3000w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M-1202x801.jpg 1202w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M-1350x900.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /></p>\n<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> MTC has been scheduled for October 11-12, 2018, and Crane will return to moderate again. Thinking about themes that are still unfolding in this sphere and news that may emerge between now and the next conference, she lists several topics that she\u2019ll be following.</p>\n<p>Cost developments \u201cwill be very interesting to watch,\u201d she says. \u201cOne thing that became clear from the conference is that AM methods make sense when you\u2019re talking about very high value parts like jet engine parts. But there will need to be significant developments before this becomes cost-effective at scale in, for example, the auto industry as a whole. Watching how processes develop and costs develop will be a fascinating aspect.\u201d</p>\n<p>In her view as a journalist, another good story is \u201chow we certify control quality in the field and how we are going to have to rethink certification and quality control,\u201d she says. \u201cThat may sound like a dusty academic topic, but it\u2019s of crucial importance. One story that was told at the conference was of an aircraft part that had been designed but couldn\u2019t be put into use because they couldn\u2019t figure out how to sign off on it in terms of certification. So that development, too, I think will be fascinating.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks forward to hearing more about each of these aspects of AM during the 2018 MTC and is eager to learn about \u201cnew applications and the way additive challenges business models.\u201d And finally, as a journalist who frequently covers stories related to economic policy, she hopes to hear \u201cmore about how the different stakeholders can and must work together to bring this really exciting technology forward.\u201d</p>\n<p>She asks, \u201cWhat kind of a push is it going to take from academia and from policy makers to really bring this forward?\u201d And in that question, she captures the central idea of the MTC: to bring together representatives of industry, academia, government, and associations to partner in creating the future of manufacturing. As MTC host, Oerlikon is delighted to count on Crane\u2019s collaboration as conference moderator\u2014and with her, awaits the next breaking news about this remarkable field.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2156\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon MTC\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3.jpg 3000w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3-1202x801.jpg 1202w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3-1350x900.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Born in the U.S.A. and based in Germany, journalist and moderator Melinda Crane brings to her work an educational background that includes law and economics.

Based at the technical university in Delft, The Netherlands, its 130 members share a big dream: to reach outer space. Using materials and technologies from Oerlikon Metco, they have moved a significant step closer to their lofty goal.</em></p>\n<p><script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js\" async></script></p>\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_0hqfbsk651 dnt=1 seo=false videoFoam=true\" style=\"height:100%;width:100%\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Until 2016, the students from Delft held the European altitude record for a rocket built by students. That year, the record was snatched from them by the team at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. With the Stratos III, DARE\u2019s largest project, they hope to bring the record back to The Netherlands \u2014 and build on the momentum generated by the Stratos I and Stratos II+ rockets\u2019 success. A flight altitude of 32,300 meters will achieve this goal. However, the group working with Felix Lindemann, the Stratos III team leader, is aiming for a good deal more: \u201cIf everything works right, then our rocket will achieve a flight altitude of 60 to 80 km,\u201d he explains.</p>\n<h4><strong>The engine as an influencing variable</strong></h4>\n<p>He notes that \u201ca prognosis like this is always a bit risky.\u201d That\u2019s because flight altitude potential depends on quite a few considerations. The air density at the launch site and the wind conditions in the atmosphere are just two of the variables. Each has considerable influence but can be calculated with only limited accuracy.</p>\n<p>What can be controlled by the rocket builders (and is therefore of decisive importance) is combustion time: how long the engine burns. It must generate the necessary thrust, and every tenth of a second of combustion time results in more meters in altitude. For this reason, the engine is being thoroughly tested during the development phase, Lindemann explains: \u201cAt the moment, we have achieved a combustion time of 15 seconds for the rocket engine. Our goal is to increase this to 28 seconds.\u201d</p>\n<h4><strong>Hot nozzle</strong></h4>\n<p>However, a longer combustion time also means higher temperatures at the nozzle. The flame in the combustion chamber is about 3,000 K hot, or somewhat more than 2,700 degrees Celsius. At the outlet of the nozzle, the temperature is still about 2,000 K. \u201cThis temperature is influenced by the shape of the nozzle, which, in turn, is also a significant factor for the thrust,\u201d says Felix Lindemann. \u201cThe nozzle must not become deformed under any circumstances, even when subject to such a high thermal load.\u201d</p>\n<p>In order to optimize the engine and the ignition sequence, test nozzles made of graphite are being manufactured first. This material provides sufficient thermal stability, but is too heavy for later use in the actual rocket. Consequently, Lindemann\u2019s team is working with a hybrid structure for these components in which only the parts that are subject to the greatest thermal loading are made of graphite. However, the calculations are turning out to be a challenge: \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that we are working at the very limits of what is technically possible as to whether and how many components in the nozzle can be replaced \u2014 and whether this will prove worthwhile in the end,\u201d he says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2118\" style=\"max-width: 1410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2118 size-full\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20170713_114039-e1517475813726.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon DARE Rocket nozzle Metco\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1094\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Material and technology from Metco: Outlet of the Stratos III nozzle, additively manufactured with a titanium alloy powder and treated with a heat-protecting coating made of zirconium oxide.</p></div>\n<h4><strong>Material and technology from Oerlikon Metco</strong></h4>\n<p>Oerlikon Metco is providing the young researchers with support in the development work. The company is supplying a highly temperature-resistant titanium alloy powder to DARE project corporate partner 3D Systems, which is building the nozzle outlet using the additive manufacturing process with laser melding. The demands for temperature stability would not be met by titanium alone: \u201cIn order to reduce the thermal load, Oerlikon Metco had the idea of additionally coating the component with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide at their Swiss location,\u201d says Felix Lindemann. And he is pleased at the current status of the development work: \u201cTwo nozzles have already been tested and the results are very promising: At least the two last centimeters of the so-called \u2018divergent section,\u2019 meaning the outermost part of the outlet, can be replaced with this material.\u201d</p>\n<h4><strong>End spurt</strong></h4>\n<p>The rocket is not yet ready for launch. Many tests are still pending before the exact launch date can be determined. As things stand today, though, all should be ready by the early part of 2018. Until then, Lindemann says, the students have a good deal to do, as \u201c70 hours per week and sometimes more is the standard for members of the core team.\u201d</p>\n<p>DARE is no \u201cextra-curricular\u201d activity. Semester breaks are being sacrificed and semesters on leave invested. But an enthusiastic student member says it is worthwhile: \u201cWe love what we are doing here. We have a great deal of freedom in the project and are able to develop and make decisions ourselves. That includes from the start to the finish \u2014 in fact, from the design of the individual components on to the testing.\u201d</p>\n<p>And what about the competition with the other student teams? \u201cOh, that shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously. We exchange information and now and then there are team members who worked in a team from a different country just as enthusiastically \u2014 as I did as well.\u201d Felix Lindemann smiles slyly: \u201cBut we\u2019ve made great progress in Delft. With the Stratos III we\u2019re going to get the record back.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2122\" style=\"max-width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2122\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DSC_0087-e1517476261149.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1277\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Part of the Stratos III team after the successful first test of the rocket engine.</p></div>\n<h4><strong>DARE and Stratos III</strong></h4>\n<p>Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering (DARE) was founded in 2001 at the Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, and today has about 130 student members.

Hecht</em></p>\n<p>The fantasy of time travel is that it takes us not just to another era, but in some ways to another planet\u2014one that lacks our modern capabilities and conveniences. We imagine experiencing Florence during the age of Michelangelo and da Vinci, being witness to court intrigues in Elizabethan England, or sharing beer and conversation with Ben Franklin after one of his experiments. At the same time, we can\u2019t conceive of being truly \u201cunplugged,\u201d cut off from science and technology, and left to survive in an analog world.</p>\n<p>But in some ways, the past would be more familiar than we imagine. You\u2019ve heard the expression \u201cthe winds of change.\u201d Well, it turns out that wind has been powering technological change for more than 7000 years.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how long ago Egyptian sailors were harnessing wind power to navigate the Nile. In the Middle East, windmills were in widespread use for food production by the 11<sup>th</sup> century. Dutch traders brought the idea home to the Netherlands, where windmill power was used to manage water levels in the Rhine River Delta. And when the electrical grid was still in its infancy, wind farms made up for gaps in its coverage and brought lighting to homes and buildings in remote locations.</p>\n<p>Today, the wind industry is generating jobs as well as renewable energy. It employed 1.1 million people globally as of the end of 2015, and by 2020, it\u2019s expected to provide jobs for 520,000 people in the EU alone. Wind power plants generate 3.7 percent of energy consumed globally, a figure that\u2019s expected to rise dramatically as wind power sustains double-digit annual growth.</p>\n<p>Already, wind energy systems are installed in 80 countries, led by China, the U.S.A., Germany, and India. Given that China and India represent more than a third of the world\u2019s population, the long-term market potential for wind energy is clear.</p>\n<p>This is good news for companies that manufacture wind turbines and components, but that good news is tempered by emerging challenges. To meet increasing demand, wind energy equipment is becoming physically larger, which places additional stress on turbines and individual parts.</p>\n<p>One example is the ring gear in a modern wind turbine\u2019s gear box. The ring\u2019s diameter may be as great as three meters, which presents a risk of warping. Other components ensure optimal operating efficiency: yaw rings position the nacelle\u2014the upper part of the system\u2014to ensure that it faces right into the wind, while pitch gears position the rotor blades to maximize energy exploitation. Each of these parts must operate at peak performance, and each therefore must be protected against wear, erosion, and corrosion.</p>\n<p>Engineers at Oerlikon work in collaboration with manufacturers to meet those challenges and develop solutions that contribute to wind energy\u2019s potential. One resulting innovation is treatment of ring gears with Balitherm Ionit, a plasma nitriding process from Oerlikon Balzers that achieves a significant reduction in warping and increases load-bearing capacity.</p>\n<p>Equally important improvements in the protection are available for yaw rings and pitch gears. Zinc or zinc-aluminum coatings applied via electric arc wire spraying reduce their risk of corrosion. The Oerlikon Metco team in Weissenborn, Germany even developed a means of using thermal spraying to regenerate and repair damaged rotor shafts to extend their useful lives.</p>\n<p>No one can pull innovation out of thin air.

While developing the \u201cStadtfuchs,\u201d Urwahn relied on technology and support from Oerlikon subsidiary citim, which works in the area of additive manufacturing of metal components. </em></p>\n<p>Sebastian Meinecke is a sports engineer, product designer and enthusiastic bicyclist. He financed his education by establishing his own production facility, in which he built truly distinctive bicycles. Even then, he was already passionately involved in the areas of design, functionality and integration. Nonetheless, he wanted more: \u201cMy dream was to develop a bicycle on my own that elegantly unified design and functionality, was specifically adapted to suit the everyday circumstances of the city and thereby to take urban mobility to a whole new level.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea simply never let him go, and his enthusiasm proved contagious. He persuaded Konrad J\u00f6r\u00df and Ramon Thomas, members of the scientific staff at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, to join him in the development of a new type of bicycle. Soon they registered a patent and founded the start-up \u201cUrwahn Engineering.\u201d The term \u201cUr-wahn\u201d is a coinage which, in German, clearly underscores the young founders\u2019 objective: Urban (ur) engineering connected with the passion, even obsession, and the committed determination (wahn) to create new, innovative and perhaps previously unimagined products.</p>\n<h4><strong>Elegant appearance, outstanding functionality</strong></h4>\n<p>Motivated and driven by the interdisciplinary model of \u201cIntegrated Design Engineering,\u201d Urwahn places humans and their needs at the focus of their bicycle conceptualization. The central innovation that arose in this connection is a completely new type of bicycle frame whose design is a complete departure from the well-known trapezoidal shape. Employing a comprehensive form closure of the front and rear parts, they succeeded in giving the rear wheel an elastic suspension. This helps absorb shocks on rough terrain. By eliminating typical commercially-available spring suspension systems, they reduced weight while retaining a comfortable ride. Further innovative details, such as powerful LED lighting and a GPS tracking system that serves as a theft deterrent are fully integrated in the frame and make the bicycle truly unique. \u201cOur constant focus at every turn was a reduction to the most basic elements, which is the source of the bicycle\u2019s delicate and elegant appearance,\u201d describes Sebastian Meinecke.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2079\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"6987\" height=\"4663\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid.jpg 6987w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid-749x500.jpg 749w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid-1349x900.jpg 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6987px) 100vw, 6987px\" /></p>\n<h4>\u201c3D printing\u201d for a unique result</h4>\n<p>The frame of the \u201cStadtfuchs V2\u201d (\u201cCity Fox V2\u201d) was fabricated in Barleben, Germany, by citim GmbH, which is part of the Oerlikon Group. It is made of 1.4404 stainless steel, a very highly corrosion resistant chrome-nickel-molybdenum steel, which was shaped by means of additive manufacturing. Using the process of Selective Laser Melting (SLM), the powdered material was applied and melted layer by layer, which results in the creation of a three-dimensional object. This manufacturing process opens up completely new shaping and forming possibilities and thus the production of component geometries which would be unthinkable with other production processes.</p>\n<p>Founded in 1996 as a spin-off (as was Urwahn itself) of the Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg, citim specializes in additive manufacturing of metal components. This process eliminates the costly and time-intensive mold-making procedure and thus makes it possible to create prototypes in a short time. The component can be modified quickly and without complications during the development process. \u201cOur collaboration with citim was fantastic,\u201d states Sebastian Meinecke. \u201cWe were assisted by the citim team in every respect, both in the selection of the most suitable manufacturing process as well as in the design of the frame and ultimately, even in the perfecting of the frame\u2019s surface finish.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the context of the ego.-Gr\u00fcndungstransfer programme, their project received funding from the European Regional Development Fund via the Saxony-Anhalt Investment Bank. Because the subsidies were approved for only a limited time period, the team was under tremendous deadline pressure. \u201cTogether with citim, we were nonetheless able to produce a fully functional prototype within a matter of only a few weeks,\u201d explains the product designer.</p>\n<h4>Internationally successful, anchored in the region</h4>\n<p>The \u201cStadtfuchs\u201d has engendered international excitement since its unveiling. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re very pleased about this. Of almost greater importance for us, however, is that we have developed a product than is strongly anchored in the region,\u201d Sebastian Meinecke notes enthusiastically. \u201cWe not only use sustainable processes and materials for production, but are also creating jobs at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The \u201cStadtfuchs\u201d will soon be available on the market. The Urwahn team is already brewing up new ideas. We are looking forward to further surprises.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2088\" style=\"max-width: 2510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2088 size-full\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new.jpg 2500w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new-1201x801.jpg 1201w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new-1350x900.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Perfectionists: The Urwahn Engineering team with Konrad J\u00f6r\u00df, Ramon Thomas and Sebastian Meinecke (from left)</p></div>\n<h4>Urwahn Engineering</h4>\n<p>Urwahn Engineering is a start-up launched in 2016 and located in Magdeburg, Germany.

June 27, 2018  print   Nonwoven materials typically have a low profile, but their impact on making lives better can\u2019t be overstated. Let us explore these versatile, remarkable materials and the many ways they make life better.          By Gwen Moran  Perhaps no type of textile touches lives in more varied ways than nonwoven fabrics. Manufactured in engineered sheets or webs of intermingled fibers, the fabric is treated mechanically, thermally or chemically to instill various properties like absorption, flexibility or strength. The result is a wide range of materials that have become critical improvements to many important industries.  Safer medicine: Virtually the entire medical industry relies on nonwoven fabrics to make medical treatment and procedures safer and more sterile. From masks, gloves and surgical scrub suits to isolation gowns and porous medical packaging that allows gas sterilization, nonwovens are essential in maintaining sanitary medical environments and practices.  Better personal hygiene: Convenient, easy to use, and disposable, nonwovens help consumers address a variety of personal needs. Baby and adult wipes, makeup removal towelettes, feminine hygiene products, and diapers are all made from nonwoven materials. These fabrics are also used to make household wipes, which help keep surfaces clean and disinfected.  Sustainable, durable infrastructure: The International Geosynthetics Society says that up to half of current carbon dioxide emissions in the world today are related to infrastructure development, according to a Nonwoven Industry report .  Nonwovens are reducing the sector\u2019s carbon footprint while playing a key role in reducing pollution, erosion, and other development impact. These textiles are being used for roadway underlayment to build more durable roads, landfill liners to help prevent toxins from leaching into soil and water, erosion control barriers to prevent soil erosion, and many other applications.  Home improvements: Their comfort, light weight, versatility and durability make nonwoven materials a staple in the home. Nonwovens are used to make weather-resistant home wraps and insulation that make home heating and cooling more energy-saving. They are also used in pillows, mattress cores, cushions, and acoustic insulation for appliances and wall paneling, making homes more quiet and comfortable.  Leisurely indulgences: Whether you like to spend your time off pursuing outdoor activities, doing a little shopping, or savoring a hot cup of coffee, nonwovens touch your life. Marine sails, tent materials, shopping bags, and even coffee filters and tea bags are all made from nonwoven textiles.  Better Lives through Better Products  \u201cAs consumers become more demanding and products must improve to remain competitive, the manufacturing technology behind these materials needs to change, as well,\u201d says Ingo M\u00e4hlmann, vice president, Oerlikon Nonwoven. The nonwoven technology team at Oerlikon focuses on developing innovative manufacturing processes that improve textile durability and functionality while maintaining sustainable production standards. Some of these include:   Nonwoven meltblown technology provides extremely high industrial wipe production capacity without sacrificing quality.  The joint venture with Teknoweb Materials (TKWM) / Italy offers hybrid technology lines to manufacture high quality wipe nonwovens for a wide variety of end-uses. The technology dispenses with hydro entanglement and subsequent drying resulting in energy and cost savings for customers. The newly-created, combined technology offers considerable synergy potential and the ideal pre-requisites for launching innovative products.  A new multi-functional forming table for meltblown nonwoven production allows customers to produce various types of meltblown nonwoven textiles with just one production line, enabling customers to develop their own innovative products and differentiate themselves within their markets.  For the efficient production of needlepunched spunbond nonwovens for geotextile purposes, Oerlikon developed an efficient and disruptive new process. The company will be the first to offer this technology to the marketplace.   \u201cThe near future is dedicated to simplify the Oerlikon Nonwoven processes by automation,\u201d M\u00e4hlmann says. \u201cThis is why Oerlikon\u2019s nonwoven business is focusing on intelligent automation and industry 4.0 developments implementing sensors and actor.\u201d As smart machines and innovative new manufacturing approaches continue to evolve, so will the applications and possibilities for nonwovens in even more areas of life.     2 comments       July 6, 2018 at 5:19 pm  Ervin Laird   I\u2019m not that much of a online reader to be honest but your sites really nice, keep it up!

The Hidden Fibers that Keep You Safer on the Road        May 04, 2018  print   While many don\u2019t give much thought to tire yarns, relentless process improvement and exceptional machinery are delivering safer, more durable, and lighter-weight options for partners and consumers.              By Gwen Moran  Many people think of tires as being made from durable slabs of synthetic material. However, they don\u2019t realize that material is made from many high modulus, low shrinkage (HMLS) yarns that are manufactured into the familiar forms that moves our vehicles along the world\u2019s highways, roads, and other surfaces and terrain.  Championship League  However, creating these versatile, durable industrial fibers is no easy feat. Tire manufacturers demand increasingly more durable materials that maintain their stability in extreme temperatures and in rigorous use. Doing so requires innovation at every level of the manufacturing process\u2014especially in tire cord production.  The high temperatures and fast speeds at which polymer materials need to be melted and spun require specialized, high-performance machinery to deliver fibers that are sufficiently tear-resistant, but elastic and temperature as well as dimensionally stable. The higher the spinning and winding speeds, the more sensitive the filaments respond to even the slightest irregularities in polymer melt, possibly resulting in breakage that can affect quality. Oerlikon Barmag is one of just two companies worldwide that deliver machine solutions for the production of HMLS yarn.  \u201cHMLS yarn machines are \u2018champion\u2019s league\u2019 among industrial yarn machines,\u201d says Markus Reichwein, Oerlikon Barmag\u2019s Head of Product Management. The machinery components must remain stable under punishing conditions. In addition, process engineers must continuously optimize the spinning process from melt to yarn to meet customers\u2019 high expectations.  Improved Performance  As a result, Oerlikon\u2019s machines are able to achieve the world\u2019s fastest spinning process with speeds of around 6300m/min and temperatures reaching as high as 260\u00b0C. In addition, the team intensively reviews product performance at every stage of the tire cord manufacture\u2014including, twisting, weaving and dipping\u2014to ensure that the final treated fabric meets rigorous standards and to identify possible process and machine improvements, adds Roy Dolmans, Team Leader of Industrial Yarn Process at Oerlikon Barmag.  \u201cWith our latest developments it is possible to process higher polymer viscosities at lower temperatures,\u201d Dolmans says. The result is a moderate treatment that produces a thicker polymer melt, improving the material\u2019s tenacity and stability. In other words, tougher materials from which to make tires.  Sustainable Innovation  Just as constant innovation leads to improvements in manufacturing processes and outcomes, it also has an impact on sustainability. Customers want to know that their manufacturing partners have environmentally sound practices. Oerlikon\u2019s EvoQuench manufacturing process reduces the air volume necessary to solidify molten filaments. In addition, the use of high-frequency heating coils inside some components lead to less energy loss while heating the yarn faster and more precisely than conventional heating technology.  As the market shifts, both Dolmans and Reichwein say that there is a strong push for process automation to minimize labor costs, improve efficiency, and increase yarn quality. Tire manufacturers are looking for more durable fabrics that can manage the same load at a lower weight. Through process improvement and digitization, companies like Oerlikon Barmag have greater methods of handling, visualizing and analyzing data to improve efficiency and save money while delivering on customer expectations.  Achieving those varied facets of improvement \u201crequires not only a very high competency and accuracy in designing and manufacturing the machines, it also requires deep HMLS process know how to exactly define the correct hardware specification as well as also the required process settings,\u201d Reichwein says. When achieved, it is the consumer who ultimately benefits from an affordable, exceptional product, sustainably produced.     2 comments       May 5, 2018 at 3:43 pm  Rajesh Hambarde   Good piece of information; some of the facts are surprises.

Why not show investors, customers, scientists, media representatives and talented young people what actually lies behind the annual reports, market shares and stock market analyses? That was the idea behind this event.  With this in mind, some 100 visitors came to the Culture and Convention Center Lucerne on April 10, 2018, to listen to talks about fascinating technologies that produce surprising solutions. How and where they are used was shown in images projected onto the wall behind the podium during the breaks. Wind farms, airplanes, cars, tools, medical technology, airbags, safety belts, motors, and much more.

In collaboration with Oerlikon Balzers, Siemens PG was able to further increase the performance limit of the test bed by improving its water brake.   Moabit, Berlin. The legendary gas turbine plant at Huttenstra\u00dfe. Ayhan Cetin walks through the final assembly hall. In the middle of the hall, an order is being completed for an SGT5-4000F turbine. In a few weeks\u2019 time, this mighty, high-performance machine will be shipped from nearby Westhafen to the Middle East.  Research engineer Cetin now walks up the stairs to a gallery. From here, we see an area at the rear of the hall surrounded by white sound barriers. This is the gas turbine test bed. This, says Cetin, is where current products and new technologies are \u201cput through their paces.\u201d Several thousand measuring points provide information about performance, efficiency, effectiveness, emission levels and much more. Outsiders can only guess at what goes on behind these sound barriers. What we learn from Cetin is that the facility\u2019s water brake plays a vital role.  Extreme pressure creates challenges  The water brake consists of a steel case that contains a rotor comprising multiple wheel discs. The material: a low-alloy steel. Cetin can talk about the water brake for hours, although his explanations are more suited to the experts \u2013 just as when he waxes lyrical about the theory of boundary layer friction in turbulent flow. Put simply, high shear and friction forces cause thermal energy to be produced and extracted from the heat transfer medium (water). Depending on the regulatable flow rate and the effective frictional surface, a torque is created that works against the gas turbine that\u2019s being tested and thus absorbs the energy produced.  In 2010, Cetin was appointed system supervisor of the water brake system at the Berlin gas turbine test bed, the largest of its kind in the world. The challenges associated with a facility of this size are huge. The water brake, in particular, is subject to extreme stress and must be inspected constantly to ensure uninterrupted operation. Cetin is therefore all the more delighted to have recently succeeded in optimizing the water brake in collaboration with Oerlikon Balzers. This involved making the wheel discs more hard-wearing. The process: plasma nitriding. The product: BALITHERM\u00ae IONIT. The result: longer inspection intervals. But let\u2019s go back to the beginning.  Siemens AG is one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the field of power generation, and gas and steam turbines form the core business of the technology group. To define its portfolio, it is testing prototypes of new products and technologies. Development times and costs are deciding factors when it comes to the profitability of any company, and the high availability of the gas turbine test bay is therefore essential for Siemens PG.  In a conventional gas turbine power plant, the energy created is absorbed by the generator. In the Berlin gas turbine test bed, however, this is not the case. Here, no continuous power generation can be guaranteed, and thus it cannot be fed into the grid. The mechanical output of the gas turbine is therefore converted into waste heat via the water brake, which in effect replaces the generator and absorbs the energy produced.  What can protect against corrosion and cavitation?  The Berlin gas turbine test bed was built in 1972, with the water brake following in 1975. Over the decades, however, the demands placed on the facility increased constantly. While 100 megawatts were originally marked as the maximum total output for the test bay, this has since increased to 360 megawatts. Nowhere else in the world other than at Siemens in Berlin are these values achieved.  For a long time, the greatest challenge was presented by the functionality of the wheel discs of the water brake. The wheel discs\u2019 material is susceptible to corrosion, which is triggered as soon as contact with moisture occurs. Rust, for its part, results in the creation of cavitation, which can significantly damage the wheel discs. Cetin mentions centrifugal and coriolis forces and talks about tremendous turbulence in the system. \u201cIn many cases,\u201d he says, \u201ccavitation is caused as a result of high flow rates. As the rate increases, the static pressure of the liquid falls. If it falls to below vapor pressure, vapor bubbles are formed that are carried along in the flow and can suddenly implode. This results in the formation of microjets that cause material damage with their high speed and extreme pressure load.\u201d  Cavitation leads to vibration problems, imbalances that can impair the function of the water brake. Should several wheel discs fail, for example, the brake can no longer be operated, and the gas turbine test bed is out of action. While the discs can be mechanically reworked or exchanged if necessary, this would result in frequent inspections and high maintenance costs. There were times, says Cetin, when the wheel discs were unusable after relatively few hours of operation.  Siemens and Oerlikon: Solving it hand-in-hand  The preliminary discussions between Siemens PG and Oerlikon were held in autumn 2014. Oerlikon Balzers\u2019 Martin Fromme says: \u201cThe economic objective was to significantly increase the lifespan of the wheels.\u201d The first tests and basic analysis were carried out at the Clausthal University of Technology in 2015, and the first samples were prepared in 2016. Plasma nitriding with BALITHERM IONIT involves diffusing nitrogen 0.2 millimeters into the steel. In the test phase, the nitrided brake discs showed no corrosion or cavitation after 25% more hours of operation. \u201cThe discs looked almost the same as they did on the first day,\u201d says Cetin. The first series went into production at the beginning of 2017.   We couldn\u2019t ask for more  Now, nine months later, Ayhan Cetin still has no cause for complaint. On the contrary. Recently, a gas turbine was tested at 50 hertz. The result: no cavitation, not even any corrosion. \u201cHowever,\u201d says Cetin, \u201cwe have not yet reached the wear limit. I believe that in the future we can even aim to increase the lifespan of the wheel discs by two or three times, ideally even more.\u201d Cetin is also confident about the turbine currently in the test bed: \u201cI do not anticipate any significant maintenance, or that the brake discs will need to be replaced.\u201d So, does this mean that everything ran smoothly with the collaboration between Siemens PG and Oerlikon? \u201cWe are able to save time and money, and to improve the performance of the test bay,\u201d says Cetin. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ask for more.\u201d   AYHAN CETIN , born 1977, studied mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Berlin, where he specialized in design technology. He joined the company in January 2008 and has been responsible for the water brake in the gas turbine test bed since 2010.  A GERMAN INDUSTRIAL MONUMENT  The factory in the Moabit area of Berlin, in particular the gas turbine hall that was completed in 1909, is an internationally renowned monument of industrial architecture. The leading architect Peter Behrens was commissioned to give the building an aesthetic and unmistakable appearance without concealing its industrial significance. The result was one of clear elegance, despite the vastness of the building. It is also extremely rare for a factory building to have served its original purpose for over 100 years. The 1 000th gas turbine was produced in 2016.     2 comments       April 5, 2018 at 12:00 am  Patricia Rodriguez Lynn   It\u2019s exciting to see such tremendous results from a powerhouse collaboration. I wonder if they were hoping for this type of result in their preliminary meetings in late 2014? I can\u2019t imagine that they could have had such high expectations. It would be interesting to hear what their expectations were in the beginning.    Reply         April 5, 2018 at 10:48 am  Cialischeap   Thank you for sharing this video.

March 07, 2018  print   Tesla made a big splash with the announcement of its Semi electric truck with a planned top 800 km (500 mile) range. But the future is closer than it sounds. Multiple companies have been developing e-mobility trucks that could make a strong impact on global climate change.         By Erik Sherman  In the not too distant future, belches of black smoke and deep growling from trucks may become no more than a memory.  Trucks create more than a third of all transportation-related CO 2 emissions, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. One way to cut the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change is to make trucks electric.  Elon Musk recently announced Tesla\u2019s first electric truck, the Semi, but the move had already started. Traditional manufacturers, including Daimler, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Cummins, and startups have been pushing to introduce their own electric trucks.  E-mobility in commercial transport may sound futuristic, but it\u2019s already mainstream. Logistics and transport companies DHL and Ryder in the U.S., Titanium Transportation Group in Canada, and Italy\u2019s Fercam have all placed small initial orders of the Tesla Semi, when it eventually ships. The more trucks can be converted from fossil fuels to electric, the better the environment (assuming the constant growth of renewable sources) \u2014 and, potentially, the cheaper the cost of transportation because of enormous energy savings.  First attempts to hybridize trucks\u2019 powertrains already demonstrated their potential. Long-distance hauling could reduce overall energy use by 2 percent to 4 percent. Short-distance transport, with a higher amount of braking that can be used to recharge batteries, can achieve between 15 percent and 25 percent savings. As for passenger cars, the ambition is to achieve a full powertrain electrification.  However, big challenges remain to the further development of electric trucks. One model of the Tesla Semi will have an 800 km (500 mile) range. \u201cReferring to the official Tesla figures, this would mean a consumption of about 125 kilowatt-hours per 100 kilometers,\u201d says David Gagliardi, Director, Business Development Automotive and Global Hybrids and E-Drives of Oerlikon Graziano.  The problem is storing the electricity in the truck. For the Tesla Semi, the required battery would be massive. \u201cIf you get one battery with 1,000 kWh, it is like having ten times the batteries of a Tesla S100,\u201d Gagliardi says. That would be a 7.5 tonnes (16,500 lbs.) battery: nearly 20 percent of the weight capacity of the largest EU trucks.  Charging batteries, particularly long-distance trucking, is also tricky. Transport companies would need a web of charging stations \u2014 the electrical equivalent of diesel truck stops.  Musk has said that he wanted the trucks to charge 80 percent of their battery capacity in half an hour. \u201cIt means a power of 1.6 megawatts in the charging station,\u201d Gagliardi says. That would be like having a small power station instead of a diesel pump. \u201cThere is no infrastructure in the world currently able to sustain this type of power demand.\u201d  Such problems can and will be addressed over time, and possibly faster than anyone thinks. A decade ago, experts predicted that a kilowatt-hour of power storage in a battery would drop to $250 by 2020. But innovation made the estimate obsolete. \u201cThere are companies already buying batteries for $150 per kilowatt-hour,\u201d Gagliardi says.  One design task facing manufacturers is the gearing and drive train necessary to power an electric truck. The working principles are the same as those of an electric passenger car, but trucks need far more mechanical power to move their loads.  \u201cYou can either increase the electric motor torque or increase its speed for more power,\u201d Gagliardi says. Increasing speed is cheaper than increasing the torque, which requires longer vehicles. Higher speeds, though, bring other considerations, like high-pitched motor noise and stringent design considerations for gear boxes. However, gear and drive train design companies like Oerlikon Graziano are finding new ways to meet those challenges.  Oerlikon Graziano has 20 years of experience in developing e-mobility vehicles, from the first golf/utility transaxle to contemporary transfer cases that enable light commercial vehicles, including zero-emission city cars.     2 comments       March 8, 2018 at 11:06 am  Hugo Alberga   Very interesting to see things brought in perspective.

February 15, 2018  print   After moderating the 1st Munich Technology Conference, journalist Melinda Crane discusses additive manufacturing\u2019s news-making potential.   By Randy B. Hecht  When Melinda Crane was invited to moderate the 1 st Munich Technology Conference (MTC), she had only a \u201cgeneral layman\u2019s knowledge\u201d of the process she knew as 3D printing. As a journalist, she quickly came to appreciate Additive Manufacturing (AM) for both its capacity to reinvent manufacturing and for its news potential.  \u201cI came back from the conference with a sense of having had revealed to me an entire new field,\u201d she says.  The scale of AM\u2019s current and projected capabilities in, for example, producing automobile and airplane parts was just the beginning of what Crane found noteworthy. Equally impressive in her view was \u201cthe fact that we\u2019re talking about using materials and creating materials in a whole new way. That has profound implications for every phase of the value chain.\u201d  The certification and quality control implications also caught her attention and ranked among the most interesting discoveries she made at the conference. \u201cWe\u2019re talking in some cases about materials with entirely new properties,\u201d she says. \u201cI find that absolutely fascinating. You could say we stand at the threshold of truly a whole new era that will revolutionize applied materials science.\u201d  With a background in both law and economics, Crane naturally gravitates toward topics that feature interdisciplinary elements, and here, again, AM did not disappoint. She describes herself as fascinated by the way \u201cthis pushes the boundaries between sectors and between academic disciplines\u201d and by \u201chow we get a systemic approach that may be a challenge for some of us coming from the old world of manufacturing.\u201d   The 2 nd MTC has been scheduled for October 11-12, 2018, and Crane will return to moderate again. Thinking about themes that are still unfolding in this sphere and news that may emerge between now and the next conference, she lists several topics that she\u2019ll be following.  Cost developments \u201cwill be very interesting to watch,\u201d she says. \u201cOne thing that became clear from the conference is that AM methods make sense when you\u2019re talking about very high value parts like jet engine parts. But there will need to be significant developments before this becomes cost-effective at scale in, for example, the auto industry as a whole. Watching how processes develop and costs develop will be a fascinating aspect.\u201d  In her view as a journalist, another good story is \u201chow we certify control quality in the field and how we are going to have to rethink certification and quality control,\u201d she says. \u201cThat may sound like a dusty academic topic, but it\u2019s of crucial importance. One story that was told at the conference was of an aircraft part that had been designed but couldn\u2019t be put into use because they couldn\u2019t figure out how to sign off on it in terms of certification. So that development, too, I think will be fascinating.\u201d  She looks forward to hearing more about each of these aspects of AM during the 2018 MTC and is eager to learn about \u201cnew applications and the way additive challenges business models.\u201d And finally, as a journalist who frequently covers stories related to economic policy, she hopes to hear \u201cmore about how the different stakeholders can and must work together to bring this really exciting technology forward.\u201d  She asks, \u201cWhat kind of a push is it going to take from academia and from policy makers to really bring this forward?\u201d And in that question, she captures the central idea of the MTC: to bring together representatives of industry, academia, government, and associations to partner in creating the future of manufacturing. As MTC host, Oerlikon is delighted to count on Crane\u2019s collaboration as conference moderator\u2014and with her, awaits the next breaking news about this remarkable field.   Born in the U.S.A. and based in Germany, journalist and moderator Melinda Crane brings to her work an educational background that includes law and economics. She completed her J.D. at Harvard Law School and her Ph.D. in Political Economy at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. In addition to being an independent conference moderator, she has served as Chief Political Correspondent for Deutsche Welle TV since 2010.

Based at the technical university in Delft, The Netherlands, its 130 members share a big dream: to reach outer space. Using materials and technologies from Oerlikon Metco, they have moved a significant step closer to their lofty goal.         Until 2016, the students from Delft held the European altitude record for a rocket built by students. That year, the record was snatched from them by the team at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. With the Stratos III, DARE\u2019s largest project, they hope to bring the record back to The Netherlands \u2014 and build on the momentum generated by the Stratos I and Stratos II+ rockets\u2019 success. A flight altitude of 32,300 meters will achieve this goal. However, the group working with Felix Lindemann, the Stratos III team leader, is aiming for a good deal more: \u201cIf everything works right, then our rocket will achieve a flight altitude of 60 to 80 km,\u201d he explains.  The engine as an influencing variable  He notes that \u201ca prognosis like this is always a bit risky.\u201d That\u2019s because flight altitude potential depends on quite a few considerations. The air density at the launch site and the wind conditions in the atmosphere are just two of the variables. Each has considerable influence but can be calculated with only limited accuracy.  What can be controlled by the rocket builders (and is therefore of decisive importance) is combustion time: how long the engine burns. It must generate the necessary thrust, and every tenth of a second of combustion time results in more meters in altitude. For this reason, the engine is being thoroughly tested during the development phase, Lindemann explains: \u201cAt the moment, we have achieved a combustion time of 15 seconds for the rocket engine. Our goal is to increase this to 28 seconds.\u201d  Hot nozzle  However, a longer combustion time also means higher temperatures at the nozzle. The flame in the combustion chamber is about 3,000 K hot, or somewhat more than 2,700 degrees Celsius. At the outlet of the nozzle, the temperature is still about 2,000 K. \u201cThis temperature is influenced by the shape of the nozzle, which, in turn, is also a significant factor for the thrust,\u201d says Felix Lindemann. \u201cThe nozzle must not become deformed under any circumstances, even when subject to such a high thermal load.\u201d  In order to optimize the engine and the ignition sequence, test nozzles made of graphite are being manufactured first. This material provides sufficient thermal stability, but is too heavy for later use in the actual rocket. Consequently, Lindemann\u2019s team is working with a hybrid structure for these components in which only the parts that are subject to the greatest thermal loading are made of graphite. However, the calculations are turning out to be a challenge: \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that we are working at the very limits of what is technically possible as to whether and how many components in the nozzle can be replaced \u2014 and whether this will prove worthwhile in the end,\u201d he says.  Material and technology from Metco: Outlet of the Stratos III nozzle, additively manufactured with a titanium alloy powder and treated with a heat-protecting coating made of zirconium oxide.  Material and technology from Oerlikon Metco  Oerlikon Metco is providing the young researchers with support in the development work. The company is supplying a highly temperature-resistant titanium alloy powder to DARE project corporate partner 3D Systems, which is building the nozzle outlet using the additive manufacturing process with laser melding. The demands for temperature stability would not be met by titanium alone: \u201cIn order to reduce the thermal load, Oerlikon Metco had the idea of additionally coating the component with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide at their Swiss location,\u201d says Felix Lindemann. And he is pleased at the current status of the development work: \u201cTwo nozzles have already been tested and the results are very promising: At least the two last centimeters of the so-called \u2018divergent section,\u2019 meaning the outermost part of the outlet, can be replaced with this material.\u201d  End spurt  The rocket is not yet ready for launch. Many tests are still pending before the exact launch date can be determined. As things stand today, though, all should be ready by the early part of 2018. Until then, Lindemann says, the students have a good deal to do, as \u201c70 hours per week and sometimes more is the standard for members of the core team.\u201d  DARE is no \u201cextra-curricular\u201d activity. Semester breaks are being sacrificed and semesters on leave invested. But an enthusiastic student member says it is worthwhile: \u201cWe love what we are doing here. We have a great deal of freedom in the project and are able to develop and make decisions ourselves. That includes from the start to the finish \u2014 in fact, from the design of the individual components on to the testing.\u201d  And what about the competition with the other student teams? \u201cOh, that shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously. We exchange information and now and then there are team members who worked in a team from a different country just as enthusiastically \u2014 as I did as well.\u201d Felix Lindemann smiles slyly: \u201cBut we\u2019ve made great progress in Delft. With the Stratos III we\u2019re going to get the record back.\u201d  Part of the Stratos III team after the successful first test of the rocket engine.  DARE and Stratos III  Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering (DARE) was founded in 2001 at the Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, and today has about 130 student members. With numerous projects, DARE offers students the opportunity to gather practical experience in the development and the construction of rockets as of the first year of studies. Stratos III is the largest of the more than 100 rockets which have been launched into space since the founding of DARE.  Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC)  Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) reduce the transfer of heat and isolate the substrate. The low thermal conductivity and the high thermal coefficients of expansion of Oerlikon Metco\u2019s coating solutions offer decided advantages: Longer service life of the components at the permissible, higher temperatures and a significantly improved degree of thermal efficiency.

Hecht  The fantasy of time travel is that it takes us not just to another era, but in some ways to another planet\u2014one that lacks our modern capabilities and conveniences. We imagine experiencing Florence during the age of Michelangelo and da Vinci, being witness to court intrigues in Elizabethan England, or sharing beer and conversation with Ben Franklin after one of his experiments. At the same time, we can\u2019t conceive of being truly \u201cunplugged,\u201d cut off from science and technology, and left to survive in an analog world.  But in some ways, the past would be more familiar than we imagine. You\u2019ve heard the expression \u201cthe winds of change.\u201d Well, it turns out that wind has been powering technological change for more than 7000 years.  That\u2019s how long ago Egyptian sailors were harnessing wind power to navigate the Nile. In the Middle East, windmills were in widespread use for food production by the 11 th century. Dutch traders brought the idea home to the Netherlands, where windmill power was used to manage water levels in the Rhine River Delta. And when the electrical grid was still in its infancy, wind farms made up for gaps in its coverage and brought lighting to homes and buildings in remote locations.  Today, the wind industry is generating jobs as well as renewable energy. It employed 1.1 million people globally as of the end of 2015, and by 2020, it\u2019s expected to provide jobs for 520,000 people in the EU alone. Wind power plants generate 3.7 percent of energy consumed globally, a figure that\u2019s expected to rise dramatically as wind power sustains double-digit annual growth.  Already, wind energy systems are installed in 80 countries, led by China, the U.S.A., Germany, and India. Given that China and India represent more than a third of the world\u2019s population, the long-term market potential for wind energy is clear.  This is good news for companies that manufacture wind turbines and components, but that good news is tempered by emerging challenges. To meet increasing demand, wind energy equipment is becoming physically larger, which places additional stress on turbines and individual parts.  One example is the ring gear in a modern wind turbine\u2019s gear box. The ring\u2019s diameter may be as great as three meters, which presents a risk of warping. Other components ensure optimal operating efficiency: yaw rings position the nacelle\u2014the upper part of the system\u2014to ensure that it faces right into the wind, while pitch gears position the rotor blades to maximize energy exploitation. Each of these parts must operate at peak performance, and each therefore must be protected against wear, erosion, and corrosion.  Engineers at Oerlikon work in collaboration with manufacturers to meet those challenges and develop solutions that contribute to wind energy\u2019s potential. One resulting innovation is treatment of ring gears with Balitherm Ionit, a plasma nitriding process from Oerlikon Balzers that achieves a significant reduction in warping and increases load-bearing capacity.  Equally important improvements in the protection are available for yaw rings and pitch gears. Zinc or zinc-aluminum coatings applied via electric arc wire spraying reduce their risk of corrosion. The Oerlikon Metco team in Weissenborn, Germany even developed a means of using thermal spraying to regenerate and repair damaged rotor shafts to extend their useful lives.  No one can pull innovation out of thin air. But now\u2014as throughout history\u2014creative minds are finding ways to put innovation into the air and the power it generates. By building on past achievements, new engineering developments are making wind a significant resource in the world\u2019s renewable energy future.

While developing the \u201cStadtfuchs,\u201d Urwahn relied on technology and support from Oerlikon subsidiary citim, which works in the area of additive manufacturing of metal components.  Sebastian Meinecke is a sports engineer, product designer and enthusiastic bicyclist. He financed his education by establishing his own production facility, in which he built truly distinctive bicycles. Even then, he was already passionately involved in the areas of design, functionality and integration. Nonetheless, he wanted more: \u201cMy dream was to develop a bicycle on my own that elegantly unified design and functionality, was specifically adapted to suit the everyday circumstances of the city and thereby to take urban mobility to a whole new level.\u201d  The idea simply never let him go, and his enthusiasm proved contagious. He persuaded Konrad J\u00f6r\u00df and Ramon Thomas, members of the scientific staff at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, to join him in the development of a new type of bicycle. Soon they registered a patent and founded the start-up \u201cUrwahn Engineering.\u201d The term \u201cUr-wahn\u201d is a coinage which, in German, clearly underscores the young founders\u2019 objective: Urban (ur) engineering connected with the passion, even obsession, and the committed determination (wahn) to create new, innovative and perhaps previously unimagined products.  Elegant appearance, outstanding functionality  Motivated and driven by the interdisciplinary model of \u201cIntegrated Design Engineering,\u201d Urwahn places humans and their needs at the focus of their bicycle conceptualization. The central innovation that arose in this connection is a completely new type of bicycle frame whose design is a complete departure from the well-known trapezoidal shape. Employing a comprehensive form closure of the front and rear parts, they succeeded in giving the rear wheel an elastic suspension. This helps absorb shocks on rough terrain. By eliminating typical commercially-available spring suspension systems, they reduced weight while retaining a comfortable ride. Further innovative details, such as powerful LED lighting and a GPS tracking system that serves as a theft deterrent are fully integrated in the frame and make the bicycle truly unique. \u201cOur constant focus at every turn was a reduction to the most basic elements, which is the source of the bicycle\u2019s delicate and elegant appearance,\u201d describes Sebastian Meinecke.   \u201c3D printing\u201d for a unique result  The frame of the \u201cStadtfuchs V2\u201d (\u201cCity Fox V2\u201d) was fabricated in Barleben, Germany, by citim GmbH, which is part of the Oerlikon Group. It is made of 1.4404 stainless steel, a very highly corrosion resistant chrome-nickel-molybdenum steel, which was shaped by means of additive manufacturing. Using the process of Selective Laser Melting (SLM), the powdered material was applied and melted layer by layer, which results in the creation of a three-dimensional object. This manufacturing process opens up completely new shaping and forming possibilities and thus the production of component geometries which would be unthinkable with other production processes.  Founded in 1996 as a spin-off (as was Urwahn itself) of the Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg, citim specializes in additive manufacturing of metal components. This process eliminates the costly and time-intensive mold-making procedure and thus makes it possible to create prototypes in a short time. The component can be modified quickly and without complications during the development process. \u201cOur collaboration with citim was fantastic,\u201d states Sebastian Meinecke. \u201cWe were assisted by the citim team in every respect, both in the selection of the most suitable manufacturing process as well as in the design of the frame and ultimately, even in the perfecting of the frame\u2019s surface finish.\u201d  In the context of the ego.-Gr\u00fcndungstransfer programme, their project received funding from the European Regional Development Fund via the Saxony-Anhalt Investment Bank. Because the subsidies were approved for only a limited time period, the team was under tremendous deadline pressure. \u201cTogether with citim, we were nonetheless able to produce a fully functional prototype within a matter of only a few weeks,\u201d explains the product designer.  Internationally successful, anchored in the region  The \u201cStadtfuchs\u201d has engendered international excitement since its unveiling. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re very pleased about this. Of almost greater importance for us, however, is that we have developed a product than is strongly anchored in the region,\u201d Sebastian Meinecke notes enthusiastically. \u201cWe not only use sustainable processes and materials for production, but are also creating jobs at the same time.\u201d  The \u201cStadtfuchs\u201d will soon be available on the market. The Urwahn team is already brewing up new ideas. We are looking forward to further surprises.

Harnessing its power responsibly is the essence of innovation in hydropower turbine coatings.  By Randy B. Hecht  Picture the world as it was in 1868. That\u2019s the year \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d Cody began working as a scout for the U.S. Army. French astronomer Pierre-Jules-C\u00e9sar Janssen discovered helium. Japan\u2019s shogunate era came to a close.  How long after these events did the first home use lighting provided by hydroelectricity? If you answered \u201cthat same year,\u201d give yourself a gold star. That\u2019s right: 11 years before Thomas Edison introduced the world\u2019s first incandescent light bulb, Cragside\u2014the Northumberland home of Lord Armstrong\u2014featured a single lamp powered by hydroelectricity.  Nearly 150 years later, renewables generate 23% of the world\u2019s electricity supply\u2014and hydropower accounts for more than 70% of the total. That means more than a billion people in 152 countries depend on this resource, the International Hydropower Association says. And the International Energy Agency projects that \u201cemerging economies have the potential to double hydroelectric production by 2050, preventing up to 3 billion tons of CO 2 annually.\u201d  These increases in capacity coincide with a growing global market for energy that makes it necessary to sustain higher levels of hydropower output. The same market pressures are driving expansion into less accessible, more contaminated waterways that present higher levels of silt, sand, or gravel debris. These factors combine to present immediate or potential challenges to continuous operation of hydropower plants.  With demand surging, utilities must achieve higher levels of water pressure and velocity, which can put additional strain on turbines. In remote locations, a higher volume of particles in the water increases the risk of damage to or accelerated wear on turbine components. And sometimes, when one set of operating conditions presents certain problems, the opposite conditions just present different problems. For example, turbines that operate under higher water pressure and velocity suffer higher rates of erosion\u2014but lower pressure results in greater wear from debris.  To minimize such risks, advanced coating materials and techniques must work in conditions that vary significantly from one hydropower site to the next. Customized coating materials and technologies make it possible to address each turbine\u2019s unique requirements and each environment\u2019s conditions. These coatings can extend the life of the turbine by three to five times the lifespan of uncoated components. They also allow hydroelectricity projects to maintain their power output and so to remain an effective renewable energy resource.  Coating systems and processes offer additional opportunities for customization. With names such as high velocity oxy-fuel, atmospheric plasma spray, and wire combustion spray, the systems can sound like science fiction. But their impact on turbines\u2019 productive life is real.  Oerlikon Metco has been working with leading hydropower turbine manufacturers since decades and can perform its coating services at the company\u2019s facilities or on the client\u2019s premises. Its approach to partnering with manufacturers and operators helps to ensure optimal turbine \u2013 efficiency, and the breadth of its experience in the sector enables to recommend the best available coating option. As demand for renewable energy sources continues to grow, the company will build on this expertise by pursuing new advances in coating materials and application techniques.  Hydroelectricity has taken us a long way from that single lamp in the English countryside. Coating materials and technologies are key to ensuring that it takes us even further. Just as life depends on water, the future depends on innovations that power growth without depleting the earth.     1 comments       June 5, 2018 at 9:21 am  Raman   I am surprised to see the technology. I stayed near to an Hydroelectric Project for almost 21 years and often visited there with my dad. But to my Surprise how complex the technology is now . Its very advanced.

If we look back into history, eras such as the Stone or Bronze ages have been named after materials. Over the centuries, materials and the study and application of it \u2013 material science \u00ad\u2013 have gained even more in importance. Today, university materials science departments are flourishing and producing a spate of passionate materials experts and innovations.  In its edition published on December 5, 2015, The Economist described materials science as \u201cthe process of turning matter into new and useful forms.\u201d This perfectly highlights the application-oriented approach of this discipline. Materials form the foundation of all products and technologies; if we want to improve them, we need to work on the materials\u2019 level.  Here at Oerlikon, we have always found materials science to be a fundamental and fascinating field. But what motivates young people to study this particular discipline at university? To find out, we asked a student at the renowned ETH Zurich (the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where Albert Einstein himself once lectured) to explain to us what drives her and how materials scientists work:   https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Cristina-Mercandetti-ETH-Zuerich-Version-Oerlikon.mp4     No comments available  Be the first to write a comment about this article.

Despite all his training of what to do if something went wrong, his mind went blank.  \u201cThe instructor gave me the signal by clapping on my shoulder,\u201d B\u00fcchel said. \u201cI placed myself in position, didn\u2019t look down, and simply thought, \u2018So, this is how I am going to die.'\u201d  B\u00fcchel survived and found the emotional charge \u201coverwhelming.\u201d He\u2019s no stranger to physical thrills, having been in a record-tying six winter Olympics as an alpine skier. B\u00fcchel was also one of the oldest winners of a World Cup race at two-and-a-half months past his 36 th birthday.  Retired from racing since 2010, he\u2019s still an active skydiver with 1,300 completed jumps \u2026 and another 300 if you count BASE jumping \u2014 the times B\u00fcchel has leapt with a parachute from bridges and cliffs.  B\u00fcchel\u2019s most impressive jump came in 1995 over the coast of Florida, near Cape Canaveral in the United States. It was 5:30 AM and a Space Shuttle launch was scheduled to occur. \u201cAs soon as the Space Shuttle lifted off, the pilot gave us the jump signal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe left the plane and immediately opened our parachutes. So I was flying high up over the Florida coast, watching the NASA Space Shuttle lifting off in the morning sunrise.\u201d  What has kept him returning to skydiving so often is \u201cthe feeling of absolute freedom, when nothing touches you but the air.\u201d  Despite his long experience and career as a professional athlete, B\u00fcchel still feels fear on every jump. \u201cIt is a very important and helpful emotion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt keeps you aware of the danger ahead, and keeps your focus and concentration at a very high level.\u201d  The ultimate danger \u2014 the one he recognized on his very first jump \u2014 never disappears. B\u00fcchel mentally rehearses everything that could go wrong before each jump so he is ready to quickly react. Before getting on the plane, he packs the parachute, ensuring that none of the lines is tangled and that the all-important large canopy of cloth is folded to open easily and quickly when necessary. A full set of equipment can easily cost 10,000 euros, according to B\u00fcchel, but the money means nothing if the skydiver doesn\u2019t take good care of it.  The material that separates life from death is made of thin manmade fibers, most commonly polyester and nylon. The technical requirements are daunting. The massive parachute cloth must be light at about 7 kg, still strong enough not to rip into shreds when forces from 3 Gs to as much as 18 Gs snap the cloth open, and almost impenetrable by air to slow the skydiver\u2019s descent.  Parachute material has seen big changes over the years. Originally it was canvas, then silk. Eventually manufacturers started to use polyester and nylon and found that it was superior to anything that had come before: less expensive, less likely to suffer from mildew, and more elastic. More recently, Dacron and Kevlar have been tried for special parachutes used in extreme heights, although polyester and nylon are still the big favorites.  Parachute companies have to deliver consistent quality with the most advanced features available. Because creating quality industrial yarns for chutes is literally an issue of life and death.    Under the brand Oerlikon Barmag, the Oerlikon Segment Manmade Fibers is a leading manufacturer of equipment for filament spinning. The polyester, nylon, polypropylen, kevlar or aramid yarns produced with this equipment are used for various applications where the material has to meet highest quality requirements such as parachutes, bullet-proof vests, flame-resistant clothing for firefighters, and many other critical uses.

To conserve energy and reduce waste, sometimes the solution you need is one that only touches the surface of everyday equipment. Coating technology can do wonders.        August 16, 2016  print   With global climate change, a population growing by 80 million people a year, and energy demand expected to jump 40 % by 2030, these are challenging times. The world needs to learn to do with less than in the past. And yet, expectations are not likely to decrease. On the contrary, pressure will only increase as the developing world seeks its share of resources.  People need to consume less. Companies must find new ways to reduce their use of raw materials and to use less energy. Materials science \u2014 the design and improvement of the metals, plastics, and ceramics we use every day \u2014 is at the forefront of making that possible.   https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Advanced-Materials_FINAL.mp4  Click on the Video to see more facts about Surface Solutions & Advanced Materials.  In such fields as automotive and transportation, aerospace, and energy production, companies switch where they can to lighter materials. The substitutes need less energy to machine, form, move, and operate. Less energy use also means reduced carbon emissions. However, there is a drawback. Lighter materials often lack important characteristics that heavier ones have. If you replace steel with aluminum in parts of an engine, you reduce weight but lose resiliency and strength.  What materials science researchers and engineers have found is that supplementing and improving materials at the surface level can lead to less energy use, greater performance and service life, and a lighter ecological footprint.  The treatments, called coating, have been around for decades and are capable of delivering astounding benefits. You see basic examples every day, such as the color baked onto the steel tubing of a bicycle or even paint that protects the exterior of a house. But the newest high tech coatings do far more than protect from the elements or add a splash of fashion.  These days, coatings can reduce friction and improve the characteristics of moving parts in engines, brakes, turbines, control systems, seals, and valves. They help machining tools cut and shape equipment components more efficiently. Industries reduce their carbon footprint as parts and tools last longer, needing less replacement, and energy use decreases.  For example, so-called thermal spray coatings in which hot, ionized gases are used to melt metal-based powders and propel them onto the surface to create coatings in successive layers that vary in thickness from the width of a line made by a very fine ink pen to the mark a medium mechanical pencil might make. In the automotive and trucking industry, thermal spray coatings on the interior moving parts of an engine improve wear and performance characteristics. They also reduce friction, which means less energy wasted on heat and, ultimately, greater energy efficiency. In the oil and gas field, such coatings help components withstand heat, corrosion, water, abrasive soil, sand and gravel while continuing to do their job. In jet engines, the benefits from thermal spray coatings are even more impressive. For instance, the high-tech coatings used in a fleet of A320 family of aircrafts enable millions of liters of fuel to be saved and thousands of tons of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions to be reduced every single day.  Sports cars, like Porsche\u2019s 918 Spyder , also benefit from thermal spray cylinder bore coatings, getting higher performance while reducing fuel and oil consumption. Some typical improvements from surface solutions applied in automobiles are reductions in fuel consumption of between 2 % and 4 %, engine blocks that are lighter by 12 %, and a 30 % decrease in oil consumption. The benefits are important as Europe, the USA, and China put stricter limits on CO 2 emissions in the automotive industry in the coming years.  Thin-film coatings provide benefits in a different range of applications. Coatings as thin as a tenth to a fifth the diameter of a human hair reduce fuel consumption, increase durability, and improve performance. For instance, machining tools gain enhanced hardness, even diamond-grade hardness, and wear resistance, allowing those in the aerospace and energy sectors to increase productivity, efficiency, and extended tool life.  Although coating technology is something that most people never notice, it is part of the materials science revolution that helps humanity consume less without making do. Oerlikon Balzers and Oerlikon Metco are two brands at the forefront of developing thin-film, thermal spray and other coating technologies. Through materials, coating services, synchronizer and turbine components, they help companies improve performance and reduce environmental impact.

July 21, 2016  print    https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Additive-Manufacturing_FINAL-2.mp4   Powders make the difference  Think of an additive manufacturing unit as an automated espresso machine. If you want a good cup of coffee, someone needs to roast and brew good beans. In this analogy, the powders are like the powdered coffee in the capsule. No matter how good the machine or highly skilled the operator, if the powders are not top-rate, the final product will disappoint.  Find out more about Oerlikon Metco\u2019s metal powders portfolio for 3D printing in industry applications.   Additive manufacturing (AM), or often used interchangeably as 3D printing, is at work everywhere in the world. Although still in its early stages, AM has demonstrated its ability to revolutionize manufacturing, from prototypes to final products.  Here are just a few ways that AM technology has moved beyond a curiosity and become a common tool in manufacturing:   Racing car manufacturers make custom parts for stock cars to improve their performance. Because modified designs can be turned into a physical part quickly, the companies can make subtle changes to enhance speed and reliability.  AM manufactured fuel nozzles are now used in the next generation Boeing 737 MAX, an aircraft series being developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes as the successor to the Boeing 737  In biomedical engineering, 3D printing solutions can create attractive, functional and individually customized bionics, prosthetics and orthotics in far less time and at a fraction of the cost by eliminating traditional manufacturing steps that make customization costly. Different tissue types, e.g. bone, muscle and a human-scale ear made of cartilage have already been 3D printed; and in one research, the tissues were observed to not only survive but there were signs of blood tissue growth.  Construction equipment manufacturers have been able to save significant time and money by using 3D printers to create prototyped parts for testing rather than investing in tooling and molds that are often used once and then discarded as engineers move on to create the next design.  Molding companies have also added AM technology to their offerings to provide customizable injection molds or small-volume production that would have been economically unfeasible with traditional processes.  3D printed buildings are sprouting up around the world. Demonstration projects in China, the Netherlands and Italy are utilizing 3D printing to enable faster construction, lower labor costs and less pollution and waste, while offering tailor-made housing solutions that have the potential to reshape the way we build our cities. 3D printing of buildings could potentially be a solution to construct extraterrestrial structures on the moon or other planets where the environmental conditions are less conducive to human labor-intensive building practices.  Jewelers and luxury brands are using 3D printers to design and create master patterns for molds that could not have been produced solely by hand with traditional smithing tools and methods.   AM and large-scale 3D printers will literally reshape life and business as we know them. The benefits \u2014 saving money, resources and time, enabling fast innovation and product improvements, adding flexibility in the manufacturing process, avoiding waste and shortening the time-to-market \u2014 are clear, but they don\u2019t convey the magnitude of change and opportunity waiting.  In the past, bringing a product to market required a number of steps which can easily take months. Even when designs meet the needs of the market, moving into full manufacturing has been challenging. Companies had to break complex designs down into elements that could be made with traditional casting and forming techniques. Mistakes could easily creep in so products required changes and then new tooling, which is costly.  With AM, manufacturing\u2019s design, modification, and production chain of events becomes shorter. More importantly, changes are easy to accommodate, eliminating time from schedules. Companies work more efficiently and get to market faster, expanding the window in which new products can command premium pricing. As a bonus, the manufacturer only uses the material necessary to make the item, reducing waste.  Critical to the success of any AM application is the proper choice of materials. Advanced alloys can mean the difference between printing an object and making something that is truly ready for a particular use.  \u201cAdditive manufacturing has led to increased interest in the development of metals and alloys,\u201d says Dr. Dieter Sporer, AM Industry Segment Manager at Oerlikon Metco. \u201cBy developing innovations that enhance our knowledge of the relationships between powder characteristics and the resulting component quality, we have been able to lead, rather than follow, the market trend towards process-specific powders.\u201d Materials , including various steels (nickel, cobalt-chrome, and stainless) as well as titanium- and aluminum-based substances, broaden the ways additive manufacturing can make a difference in industry.  Oerlikon Metco\u2019s more than 50 years of experience in developing powder products for advanced industrial applications has placed it as a natural supplier of additive manufacturing materials.

June 10, 2016  print   Who would have thought that a revolution in manufacturing could be seen in children playing with putty? Kids pinch off pieces and add them to a base form, gradually shaping what they want. Since the late 1980s, engineers and scientists have developed technologies collectively called additive manufacturing \u2014 a commonly known type is 3D printing \u2014 that turn that playful process into an economic engine.  Computerized systems read digital design files and add materials, bit at a time, to form a completed item. \u00a0The result is nothing short of a digital revolution in an old school activity.  Once used strictly to make rough prototypes, the sophistication and breadth of applications have grown. Additive manufacturing has made Iron Man\u2019s costume gauntlets in films and created fuel nozzles for the engines in Boeing\u2019s new 737 Max.                There are powerful reasons that companies are looking at 3D printers to meet many of their needs:   Additive manufacturing can create complex parts at once rather than require the assembly of multiple pieces, saving time.  Making changes can happen as quickly as the modification of a computerized design file without needing new industrial tooling.  Engineers can create a prototype as they wait and then immediately begin to test it.  Unlike conventional manufacturing, there is no need to simplify designs to create what you\u2019ve conceived.  Because a company uses only the material needed to make an item, waste and costs are reduced.  Equipment can make a variety of items rather than be dedicated to a single type or model of product.   Innovative businesses are beginning to use this technology to fabricate products for aircraft, dental restorations, medical implants, eyeglass frames, automobiles, customized prosthetics, and architecture. New applications are being explored daily.  There are a number of additive manufacturing processes, including extruding hot materials into thin layers, depositing combinations of powders and binders to leave solids, and using heat to fuse materials together. One of the great advantages of additive manufacturing is the wide variety of substances that now can be used to create parts and products. Once limited to plastics, the technology can handle ceramics and, importantly, even high-quality metal powders that enable the production of durable objects.  Oerlikon Metco plays an essential role in these developments, providing materials and know-how to increase the durability, precision and finish of the final product.  To see how additive manufacturing is poised to revolutionize industries, look out for our next story.

It seems that working conditions of such machines will be much more restricted than convectional machines. If it is supposed to produce a directional grain structure of a turbine blade at a high temperature, how continuous and reliable can anyone d this with a 3D machine.

June 03, 2016  print   It may be the world\u2019s most versatile coating. It insulates, cools, waterproofs, and kills germs, and it blocks the sun and enables your sense of touch. But no one designed our skin. Instead, over millions of years, skin gradually changed to help humans \u2014 and the animals that came before us \u2014 adapt to the elements and thrive in an ever-changing world.  Versatile surfaces abound in plants and animals, and they deliver extraordinary performance tailored to the job at hand. Geckos use Velcro-like structures on their feet to walk up walls. Carnivorous pitcher plants coat their flowers with a ridged, nectar-laden surface so slippery that insects slide inside to their doom. Tooth enamel lets us crack a walnut in our teeth and emerge with our smile intact.        The strong adhesive nature of the gecko\u2019s feet are known to have inspired superglue. Borrowing this feature, coatings from Oerlikon are powerfully adhesive to metal surfaces, enabling tools to withstand extremely high friction, pressure, usage and heat.        The sea turtle\u2019s hard shell protects it from predators and yet has the right amount of friction for it to swim and maneuver quickly underwater. Mimicking this, Oerlikon coatings also protect turbines used in hydropower generation from wear and erosion, enabling the blades to effectively rotate and optimize energy production.        Side view mirrors can be metallically coated with Oerlikon Balzers\u2019 ePD solution, shielding the mirror\u2019s turn signal during the day while enabling its safety functionality at night, just as a firefly glows as a warning signal.    Click on the red arrow to see what\u2019s behind the pictures.  \u201cInteractions at the surface control life,\u201d says Alex Dommann, Ph.D., a materials scientist who heads the \u2018Materials meet Life\u2019 department at EMPA, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, in St. Gallen, Switzerland. And nature\u2019s strategies, he says, can inspire new surface technologies beyond any yet invented.  Special coatings can make materials last longer, perform more effectively, or simply look better. Such properties are so essential that an entire discipline of surface engineering now provides critical support for the aerospace, automotive, construction, power generation and biomedical industries.  In designing new surfaces, \u201cnature already teaches us a lot of lessons,\u201d Dommann says.  Surfaces in nature can help the tissue underneath \u2014 and the organism \u2014 function well in an extreme environment. Desert plants survive long periods of extreme aridity with the help of waxy surfaces and adjustable pores that control how much water escapes into the air. Similarly, turbines in power plants work most efficiently around hot gas at high pressure. But if it gets too hot for too long, their blades, which are made from superalloys, can react with oxygen, corrode and fail. A protective coating that survives blast-furnace conditions [i] keeps oxygen from diffusing in and corroding the turbine blades. This enables the turbine to last longer and work better.  More generally, surface coatings can endow materials with properties the bulk material underneath does not possess. Placing a silver-imbued coating on titanium bone-repair screws, for example, can prevent deep infections after surgery because silver is a potent antibacterial agent. [ii]  \u201cCoatings offer the possibility of changing how a material interacts with its environment,\u201d Dommann says.  In some cases, surfaces can be designed through biomimicry \u2014 by imitating the molecular strategies that animals and plants employ. If you wanted to make a coating that repels water, you could investigate the lotus plant, says Helmut Rudigier, the chief technology officer of Oerlikon Surface Solutions Segment. Studying how plants control gas flow into a leaf could help scientists design new types of coatings that restrict the diffusion of gases, Dommann adds.  Most often, however, studying nature reveals strategies that materials scientists can pursue to develop new coatings. Synthetic surface coatings, unlike human skin, have traditionally offered one function and one function only. \u201cBut in nature a coating has a lot of different functionalities at the same time,\u201d Dommann says.  Scientists are getting better at packing multiple functions into a single surface solution.  \u201cGear surfaces in a racecar\u2019s gearbox, for example, should be hard to enable them to transfer force efficiently and with the required durability. Building them with tungsten carbide takes care of that. But they should also slide off one another easily to reduce friction and transfer maximal power to the drivetrain. Tribological coatings \u2014 coatings that reduce friction \u2014 help. To make gears slip, engineers layer in graphite, a softer, more slippery material, into the gear\u2019s surface coating. The result is a stable but low-friction gearbox that\u2019s used in Formula 1 cars.  Nature\u2019s surfaces can often adapt to changing circumstances, making almost every coating on plants or animals a smart coating. If you get a scratch on your skin, your body activates wound-healing processes to close up the scratch and replace the damaged tissue. Industrial surface solutions traditionally have not been so adaptable, but look for them to catch up in the years to come, Dommann says.  Already under development are bandages with fibers made by Oerlikon that change color if the wound they\u2019re protecting is infected. Also possible are adaptive airplane wings that shapeshift and become rougher to create the drag needed during takeoff. The pilot would no longer have to adjust flaps and winglets to get the plane off the ground, and the wings would adjust during flight to become smoother and aerodynamic.  Smarter surfaces will require less material, reduce power consumption, offer improved effectiveness, and reveal new fields of applications \u2014 all of which will help the coating business grow tremendously, Dommann says.  \u201cWe are learning from nature in different ways,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re getting closer to what nature does.\u201d  Hidden Sensors Beneath the Shine  For years, automakers have given plastic bumpers, radiator grills, and other flexible plastic parts a metallic shine by dipping them in an electrified bath containing chromium or nickel derivatives and other salts. But the chromium and nickel compounds from this process, called electroplating, contaminate wastewater, often causing ecologically damaging water pollution.  An innovative metallizing technology developed by Oerlikon Balzers can help. Like natural surface solutions, the new coating method, called ePD\u2122, adds new functions, works efficiently and avoids ecological damage.  To apply the new coating, the plastic part is coated with a UV lacquer to eliminate surface defects. Afterwards, the PVD layer is applied inline before a UV-topcoat is finally applied to protect the system.  The metallized plastic that results has the shine of chrome that customers love, but its surface is as transparent to infrared light or radar as a glass window is to sunlight. That means that sensors can be hidden below the metallized surface, such as a radar sensor beneath a bumper that measures how far away the car is from another car or a pedestrian, says Rudigier. Such sensors could prevent collisions and injuries, providing benefits that are far more than skin deep.  [i] Typical temperature inside a gas turbine is about 2000 F. Blast furnaces run from 1600-2300 F (900-1300 C).

Traditional manufacturing followed a logic whereby a part of a base material would be milled or cut away to give the product its form. In this sense, additive manufacturing is just the opposite. The extremely high flexibility in the design and the fact that the object is built up layer by layer (additive) with the help of a laser, opens up completely new possibilities in the design and development of components. It is not without reason that additive manufacturing is seen as a key factor in the next industrial revolution.  Additive manufacturing is changing the way we design components.

Its prototyping and low-volume production capabilities is already revolutionizing design, engineering, and production processes. However, for AM to evolve into a technology for mass customization, it still faces limitations. With the goal of promoting dialog and collaboration, Oerlikon, working with the Technical University of Munich (TUM), organized the first Munich Technology Conference (MTC) on the topic of additive manufacturing. At the two-day conference held in October, experts from industry, science and politics met to discuss the future and opportunities of this technology.  Each sector has its own crucial role. Science promotes the education and skills development necessary for ongoing innovation in additive manufacturing. Industry identifies opportunities to commercialize those advances. Governments must establish a political framework to accelerate the pace of integration and application of 3D printing capabilities. Associations strengthen the connections among these players and promote the technology, standards, and certifications.                \u201cWe\u2019re talking about using materials and creating materials in a whole new way.\u201d  Interview with TV journalist Melinda Crane on AM\u2019s news-making potential.

Coatings from Oerlikon Balzers are the most effective, and often the only possible means to decisively improve their operational performance.  Lighter construction, ever-increasing performance with ever-smaller dimensions, as well as environmentally friendlier concepts for operation and maintenance: these increasing demands on systems impose correspondingly greater requirements on components and tools. Oerlikon Balzers\u2019 coatings, such as the BALINIT family, BALIQ and ePD, can be tailored to the application in question and, thereby, open the way to completely new performance standards.  Coated cutting and forming tools\u00a0enable more demanding materials to be processed within shorter times, with lower processing material consumption and with better quality.\u00a0For automotive and precision components, coatings open up new design possibilities, as ever-smaller components not only withstand higher loads, but are also more reliable, longer-lasting and cost less.  Research and development as the basis for continuous innovation, lies at the centre of Oerlikon Balzer\u2019s corporate strategy. R&D is conducted primarily in Liechtenstein, and Oerlikon Balzers\u2019 researchers are at the forefront of science, publishing regularly in renowned scientific journals and giving lectures at important international conferences.  Our offerings  Coating centers: Oerlikon Balzers\u00a0operates its own coating centres in every major industrial region of Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Tens of thousands of customers make use of this contract coating option. Every day, Oerlikon Balzers coats hundreds of thousands of tools and precision components for its customers.  Coating systems: Integrate Oerlikon Balzers\u2019 coating systems and complete production lines into your own production system(s), under your own management.  In-house coating centers: For the coating of large part volumes, Oerlikon Balzers offers in-house centres operated and managed by Oerlikon Balzers, but in your premises and completely integrated into your production system.                30 years of \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d  How Mitsubishi Hitachi\u2019s appetite for advances inspires our teams                   \u201cInnovation is in our DNA\u201d  Disruptive technologies and solutions at the 2018 Oerlikon Innovation Day                   Running smoothly  How Siemens and Oerlikon boost the performance of the Berlin gas turbine test bed                   Remarkably renewable  Coating innovations are keeping wind turbines at peak performance                   The secret of Swiss watch durability and beauty  How can a thin coating start your day accurately?

After watching rocket launches and seeing mach 3+ aircraft that can traverse continents in just hours, we\u2019ve become accustomed to looking upward when imagining new vehicles of velocity. But the latest vision of high-speed transport is not a flight of fancy. Rather, it has a more down-to-earth form.        October 30, 2015  print   Called the Hyperloop, it\u2019s a scheme that proposes using vacuum technology to make inter-city transit possible at supersonic speed. How fast is fast? Runs between Paris and Rome could be completed in close to an hour. The distance between Hanoi and Shanghai could be covered in two hours. For a longer trek, how about Mexico City to Ottawa in three and a half hours? That\u2019s just a half-hour longer than travelers spend now waiting at the airport before takeoff.  It\u2019s a vision of a future in which travel costs us less time and causes less damage to the environment by reducing the carbon footprint of long-distance trips. And the possibility of achieving both goals in a single solution has attracted serious investors to the project. But for the science and business communities alike, the Hyperloop concept isn\u2019t as astounding as the fact that Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum thinks it could actually work. Late last month, science and technology media were buzzing with the news that Hyperloop Transportation Technologies and Oerlikon had signed a partnership agreement. Their collaboration brings the mission closer to reality\u2014so much so that the team plans to build a prototype of the Hyperloop in Quay Valley, California next year.  Oerlikon was drawn to the project because it offers the opportunity to create something that revolutionizes transportation and mobility. Hyperloop\u2019s success depends on mastery of vacuum technology, an area in which the original team lacked advanced expertise. \u201cThe white paper by Elon Musk contained some initial assumptions that had not been validated,\u201d says Carl Brockmeyer, Head of Business Development. \u201cOur proprietary simulation software, \u2018PASCAL,\u2019 made it possible for us to assess the entire Hyperloop in detail and calculate the vacuum equipment required for optimal operation.\u201d   Design Studien copyright Hyperloop Transportation Technologies  The software is used to simulate, test, and validate vacuum equipment and technology and to facilitate the design of complex applications used in diverse industries. It is the foundation of vacuum system solutions to customers such as CERN, which uses leak detection instruments and an array of vacuum components in the Large Hadron Collider. At the same time, it is enabling the optimized project calculations necessary to drive continued innovation in the development of flat panel displays. One element of its simulations is identification of the hardware required to make them a working reality\u2014and the software can accomplish that even when that hardware doesn\u2019t exist yet.  PASCAL provides the missing link between the conception and implementation of an engineering idea. With the Hyperloop, for example, the Oerlikon team can input the dimensions of the tube along with variables such as materials used, temperature and humidity conditions, special processes, energy consumption, and the target vacuum limit. The software takes all those variables into consideration and then simulates the optimal configuration of the tube. Once that phase of development is completed, the project will advance to technical design of the transport capsule and test track.  How much precision does the Oerlikon simulation deliver?  \u201cWe can realize any project on paper and test whether it\u2019s feasible in terms of achieving the vacuum technology,\u201d Brockmeyer says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the software itself. It\u2019s the users and know-how behind it, as well. For anybody out there who has a vision or an idea, we can figure out how you can realize it. This proprietary software gives us capabilities that are unique, at least in this form.\u201d  While outside observers\u2019 interest in the project grew when the partnership was announced, the excitement within Oerlikon centered on the opportunity to pioneer a new technology. The company frequently contributes to advances in vacuum research and development, but even by that standard, the Hyperloop presents an exceptional challenge. When Oerlikon\u2019s technologists and engineers finish work, they pursue hobbies that often involve playing with technology. For a team with that intensity of focus, the thrill of the project lies in working on something that they can honestly call visionary and even revolutionary.   Design Studien copyright Hyperloop Transportation Technologies  At the same time, they have the opportunity to spark a fundamental change in the way people think about travel, something no one has achieved for more than a century. Brockmeyer likes an analogy that Hyperloop CEO Dirk Ahlborn uses: the initial public reaction to train travel. The idea of 35 mile-per-hour rail transit ignited fear in a world accustomed to a horse-and-carriage pace of transport. People were terrified that at that speed, they would be unable to breathe. In the mid-nineteenth century, boarding a train was regarded by many as a daredevil act.  The Hyperloop again puts us in the path of the unknown, of a concept whose workings we have yet to fully grasp. If the partnership can bring it to fruition, it will have demonstrated a rare breed of thought leadership: one expressed not in words, but rather in action. In effect, the Oerlikon team is charged with helping to make the Hyperloop within our power to both execute and comprehend. \u201cWe\u2019re working on something meaningful, and it\u2019s the chance to take part in that,\u201d says Dr. Martin Fuellenbach, CEO of Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum. \u201cThis is technically feasible and achievable, and we are proud to participate in it.\u201d  By Randy B.

Additive manufacturing (3D printing) represents a reversal of the industrial manufacturing as we know it. Since time immemorial, people have used tools and then machines to cut forms out of stone or metal blocks in a process known as chipping. \u201cThe process is exactly the opposite with additive manufacturing. Instead of cutting away material, metal powder is melted with a laser and then arranged in the desired form,\u201d explains Professor Michael S\u00fcss, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Oerlikon. As a result, engineers can now build \u2013 or rather, generate \u2013 any form they want. They are no longer limited to certain shapes. For the first time, we can now create objects similar to nature.  Additive manufacturing has been used on an industrial scale for some time already, mainly in the aerospace industry and in medical technology. These are areas where a few units with highly individual forms are required, such as engine components or prostheses that can be calibrated precisely to each individual patient. But other sectors are increasingly becoming aware of the potential that additive manufacturing offers.  With the goal of promoting dialog and collaboration, Oerlikon, working with the Technical University of Munich (TUM), organized the first Munich Technology Conference (MTC) on the topic of additive manufacturing. At the two-day conference held in October, experts from industry, research and politics met to discuss the future and opportunities of this technology. It was agreed that additive manufacturing will revolutionize industrial production processes: ideas can be implemented more quickly, industrial components will become lighter thanks to bionic structures and all of this will be done with fewer resources.  Prof. Johannes Schleiffenbaum (right), RWTH Aachen University  \u201cThe beauty of additive manufacturing is that you can directly transform ideas into reality,\u201d says Professor Johannes Schleiffenbaum of RWTH Aachen University. \u201cThis will enable engineers to be more creative and develop completely new things.\u201d    Prof. Horst Wildemann, TUM  \u201cAdditive manufacturing presents opportunities in terms of economic factors, time savings and the ability to handle complexity on an unprecedented scale. And importantly, additive manufacturing is an enabler for existing processes \u2013 it makes them more efficient and better.\u201d    Michael Schrey\u00f6gg, Chief Program Officer, MTU Aero Engines AG  \u201cAdditive manufacturing achieves improvements through weight reductions of bionically designed parts. A bracket on an Airbus A350 that flight attendants use to steady themselves can now be additively manufactured with titanium \u2013 and weighs 500\u00a0g less. Extrapolating that over the 30-year life of an aircraft, this will result in a reduction of 300\u00a0000 tons of CO 2 .\u201d    Mohammad Ehteshami, Vice President and General Manager, GE Additive  \u201cAdditive manufacturing is still a young technology. But we\u2019ve come a long way. And we are already printing things that people had predicted would only be printed in 2025. I hope that additive manufacturing mass production is not ten years from now, but two years from now.\u201d    Dr. Karsten Heuser, Competence Center AM, Siemens AG  \u201cAdditive manufacturing is a big investment for Siemens. But it\u2019s also a necessary investment.\u201d    Dr. Hans J. Langer, Executive Chairman, EOS Group  \u201cIt took EOS 20 years to sell the first 1,000 systems (1990-2010), another 5 years to sell the second 1,000 systems, and the last two and a half years to sell the third 1,000 systems. Today we have a worldwide installed base of around 3,000 systems. As of 2018, we\u2019ll be able to produce and install 1,000 systems per year.\u201d    Dr. Roland Fischer, CEO Oerlikon  \u201cLooking at the industrialization of AM, there is still a lot of work to be done. However, it is not a question of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019. Once it happens, AM will bring massive changes in industry.\u201c     No comments available  Be the first to write a comment about this article.

For these reasons, they are used in auto manufacturing for radiator grilles or mirror caps, as well as for electronic appliances and bathroom fittings. Today, Oerlikon Balzers has developed an eco-friendly method for metallizing plastic components. The technology named ePD \u2122 enables parts to be metallized in a process that saves cost and resources, without yielding any harmful substances. In addition, this innovative technology opens up new and exciting designs and functionality possibilities.        October 30, 2015  print   With high-quality metallic coating, plastic components take on a luxurious chrome look. Hence, they are popularly used in design elements for cars , electrical appliances , kitchens and bathrooms . In vehicles, radiator grills, mirror caps, door handles and trim are some items with such a finish. Push buttons and covers for hi-fi equipment, cell phones and coffee machines, as well as showerheads, are further examples of products coated with this method.   ePD is the sustainable metallization solution for the automotive industry .  Plastic is gradually replacing metal as the basic material for such applications for good reason: Bernd Fischer, Head of Oerlikon Balzers, summarizes the main benefits of metallized plastic components: \u201cPlastics are light and corrosion-proof. Apart from that, plastic injection molding is a much cheaper form of manufacturing.\u201d  Eco-friendly production process  Historically, electroplating was the main method used in metallizing components, where metal ions are deposited on plastic parts in an electrolytic bath. However, this wet chemical method requires the use of chromium derivatives and nickel \u2013 substances graded as ecologically harmful. Consequently, the European Union intends to limit the use of certain chromium derivatives. And a total ban of such usage in the future cannot be ruled out. In emerging markets like Brazil or China, there is today a much greater awareness of environmental issues than just a few years ago. As a result, setting-up of new electroplating plants is becoming much more difficult even in these countries.   ePD opens new horizons in automotive interior, e.g. capacitive sensing.  The automotive, electronics and sanitary industries are therefore seeking sustainable alternatives. Oerlikon Balzers, a Business Unit of the Oerlikon Group\u2019s Surface Solutions Segment, has the answer \u2013 it has developed an exceptionally innovative method for the metallization of plastic parts. Its proprietary ePD process \u2013 e mbedded P VD for D esign Parts \u2013 is environmentally friendly and requires no metal derivatives such as chromium or nickel. With ePD coatings, there is zero heavy metal waste and no contaminated wastewater. \u201cWe are convinced that this technology can be used anywhere in the world with less costly or complicated restrictions,\u201d says Helmut Rudigier, Chief Technology Officer at Oerlikon Balzers.   ePD\u2019s attractive colours and excellent features such as corrosion resistance and light and radar transparency make it ideal for automotive exterior applications .  The new process saves costs and resources  During the ePD process, the metallic coating is applied between two layers of UV lacquer. The first layer evens out the irregularities that occur during injection molding, while the top coat serves as an effective protection against environmental factors. The metal layer between them is coated using the PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) process , which makes it possible to use substances that are environmentally friendly.  This process also helps to conserve the use of resources. The metallic layer is only about 0.2 micrometers thick as compared to coatings with electroplating which have a thickness of up to 60 micrometers. On top of that, the ePD-coated plastic parts can easily be recycled at the end of their product life-cycle.  Manufacturers benefit not only from a more efficient use of resources but also from cost savings. Components that need to be lacquered and metallized require no separate injection molding tool for the metallization process. If ePD is integrated as part of the in-house production process, there are further cost savings from eliminating the transport of semi-finished parts.  Flexible and corrosion resistant  The significantly thinner metal coating has several essential advantages. It is flexible and can even be made transparent to accommodate light or radar. Due to this flexibility, parts can be bent or stretched to a certain degree, allowing standard components to be easily modified to fit a specific design. When used in components for the exterior of cars, this malleability also increases safety. For example, in the event of an accidental collision between a pedestrian and a metallized radiator grille, there are no splinters or sharp edges, even if the grille is broken.  Moreover, coatings done using the ePD process have proven to enable excellent corrosion resistance despite the thinness of the coating layer. In the so-called \u201cRussian mud test\u201d, parts coated with this process were even resistant to highly corrosive salts, which are used to melt ice on roads in Russia and Canada.  The layers facilitate innovative functions  Another major benefit of using the ePD technology is that manufacturers gain the possibility to integrate additional innovative functions, for which electroplating only offers limited scope. Take for example radar-transparent housings \u2013 integrating a radar sensor that measures the distance to objects in front is absolutely no problem in the case of an ePD-coated radiator grille. Equally within the realms of possibility are door and trunk handles with built-in sensors to enable doors to open automatically. And because the layers can be applied such that they are transparent, symbols can also be integrated into backlit buttons. Thanks to this new technique, totally new designs with countless color, nuances and optical effects can be realized. In highly competitive markets such as automobile or consumer electronics, innovative products developed with such additional functions can make the difference for companies to gain a competitive edge.   The INUBIA I: fully integrated and automated system for high-volume plastic metallization  Use as a service or integrated in industrial production lines  Within the next few years, the ePD process could establish itself as the new industrial standard for metallizing plastic parts. \u201cIn every respect, it is a substitutional technology with enormous potential in a rapidly growing market,\u201d explains R\u00fcdiger Sch\u00e4fer, Head of ePD Technology at Oerlikon Balzers.  The Surface Solutions Segment is offering its customers the new process in two different ways. Firstly, selected coating centers of the Business Unit provide metallization as a service with the same high level of quality and fast throughput times.  Secondly, the fully automated and self-contained coating system can be integrated into current industrial production lines. This is particularly of interest to large automotive suppliers, who today usually have the plastic parts galvanized by an external partner. With ePD, they could offer this coating process as part of their own production, thereby increasing their own value-added services. \u201cRemoving the back and forth transportation of parts for coating simplifies production logistics and results in cost savings,\u201d analyzes Sch\u00e4fer. In addition, suppliers with their own ePD systems could offer their customers a wider range of innovative solutions \u2013 not only through better designs but also with new innovative functions.     4 comments       February 10, 2016 at 1:52 pm  Peter Ribando   This is an amazing article.  I did hear about the ePD technology at the leadership meeting in Berlin but had no idea it had matured this much.   I believe it will revolutionize how automobiles  and many other products are manufactured in the future.  It\u2019s great to be a part of the Surface Technology World, I find  it very interesting and it feels like every day is an adventure.

Hecht</em></p>\n<p>Many of us fantasize about living in the future. But at Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Hitachi Tool Engineering, Ltd., Kazuyuki Kubota, Head of Manufacturing Department and Head of Coating Technology, <em>actually</em> works in the future. This isn\u2019t science fiction. He hasn\u2019t mastered the art of time travel. But when it comes to coating systems and technology, Kubota never stops anticipating the next breakthrough in requirements, capabilities and performance.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2284\" style=\"max-width: 1410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2284 size-full\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beitragsbild2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beitragsbild2.jpg 1400w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beitragsbild2-890x465.jpg 890w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Beitragsbild2-768x401.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unstoppable innovator: Kazuyuki Kubota from Mitsubishi Hitachi Tool Engineering.</p></div>\n<p>This makes partnering with him something like playing with a chess master whose mind is always working three moves ahead. Some companies might find that intimidating. But the team at Oerlikon Balzers finds it inspiring. Yes, it\u2019s rewarding to bring products to market that \u201cmeet or exceed\u201d customers\u2019 expectations. But it\u2019s more interesting when each product launch motivates the customer to envision the next stage of expectations and performance standards.</p>\n<p>To put it another way: the pace of change is so rapid these days that it\u2019s no longer possible to use state of the art technology \u2014 only technology that\u2019s state of the art <em>for now</em>. Each advance establishes the foundation for the next one. And customers like Kubota drive the Oerlikon Balzers team to work continuously on being first to market with what\u2019s next.</p>\n<h4>Exacting standards, clear-cut results</h4>\n<p>The right coating can improve a tool\u2019s precision, resistance to friction and abrasion, and durability. It can also strengthen a company\u2019s reputation. For decades, Mitsubishi Hitachi Tool Engineering has relied on coatings to optimize the performance of its machinery and forming tools as well as its leadership position.</p>\n<p>The company, which manufactures and sells tips along with cutting and forming tools made of special steels or carbide alloys, has an obligation to its own customers and a commitment to growing with them. Each new generation of tools employs the latest coating technology to ensure that the company retains its competitive edge in this market. It has collaborated with Oerlikon Balzers for more than 30 years in pursuit of these goals.</p>\n<p>More than a decade ago, during development of the new Arc technology, Oerlikon Balzers introduced the INNOVA system, which enabled Kubota\u2019s team to reduce the time required to develop and manufacture many new coatings and products. Most recently, Mitsubishi Hitachi purchased the latest advance, INLENIA, a line of coating systems that Oerlikon Balzers designed for ultra-smooth surfaces. The solution attracted Kubota\u2019s interest because of benefits such as making customization possible thanks to the precise, independent scalability of pulse duration, shape, and density. This represents a significant advance beyond conventional HiPIMS (high-power impulse magnetron sputtering).</p>\n<p>\u201cHiPIMS is useful for products that require low particle coating, which is one of the features and advantages of this technology,\u201d Kubota says. \u201cTo expand our business within these product lines, we are considering installing additional systems. We want to use this system as the foundation of further research and development.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2283\" style=\"max-width: 986px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2283 size-large\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-976x801.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"976\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-976x801.jpg 976w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-609x500.jpg 609w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-768x631.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kazuyuki-Kubota-with-Wolfgang-Kalss-Blog_text-1096x900.jpg 1096w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kazuyuki Kubota and Wolfgang Kalss, Head of Marketing &amp; Product Management Tools from Oerlikon Balzers in front of an INLENIA kila.</p></div>\n<h4>Tomorrow\u2019s challenges, in focus today</h4>\n<p>But his longtime partners at Oerlikon Balzers knew that even as Mitsubishi Hitachi put the INLENIA system\u2019s potential to work, Kubota would be thinking about further advances in the technology. He continues to monitor emerging coating system developments and is already considering where to make future investments in those next-generation systems.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to develop new coatings with special compositions that are beyond the range of the conventional nitride coating in the existing market,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, we also consider that another technology is necessary to make these new coatings act properly and functionally on the cutting tools, as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>PVD (physical vapor deposition) technology is another area where there is \u201croom to progress and be improved,\u201d he says. \u201cApplying HiPIMS technologies to our products is just starting point of this progress. By using this technology, we can generate additional hints and ideas for future technologies. Our collaborative work and relationship with Oerlikon Balzers supports our search for such a new technology.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a search that shows no sign of ending \u2014 because every time these partners achieve an objective, they ask themselves what new challenge they can take on. Of course, the engineers at Oerlikon Balzers have an internal drive to build on their record of breakthroughs. But there\u2019s something empowering and inspiring about having a customer who\u2019s always wondering what can be done to improve current products and solutions.

Manufactured in engineered sheets or webs of intermingled fibers, the fabric is treated mechanically, thermally or chemically to instill various properties like absorption, flexibility or strength. The result is a wide range of materials that have become critical improvements to many important industries.</p>\n<p><strong>Safer medicine:</strong> Virtually the entire medical industry relies on nonwoven fabrics to make medical treatment and procedures safer and more sterile. From masks, gloves and surgical scrub suits to isolation gowns and porous medical packaging that allows gas sterilization, nonwovens are essential in maintaining sanitary medical environments and practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Better personal hygiene:</strong> Convenient, easy to use, and disposable, nonwovens help consumers address a variety of personal needs. Baby and adult wipes, makeup removal towelettes, feminine hygiene products, and diapers are all made from nonwoven materials. These fabrics are also used to make household wipes, which help keep surfaces clean and disinfected.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustainable, durable infrastructure: </strong>The International Geosynthetics Society says that up to half of current carbon dioxide emissions in the world today are related to infrastructure development, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nonwovens-industry.com/issues/2017-04-01/view_features/a-growing-exhibition-reflects-nonwovens-industry-t-154653/\">Nonwoven Industry report</a>.</p>\n<p>Nonwovens are reducing the sector&#8217;s carbon footprint while playing a key role in reducing pollution, erosion, and other development impact. These textiles are being used for roadway underlayment to build more durable roads, landfill liners to help prevent toxins from leaching into soil and water, erosion control barriers to prevent soil erosion, and many other applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Home improvements:</strong> Their comfort, light weight, versatility and durability make nonwoven materials a staple in the home. Nonwovens are used to make weather-resistant home wraps and insulation that make home heating and cooling more energy-saving. They are also used in pillows, mattress cores, cushions, and acoustic insulation for appliances and wall paneling, making homes more quiet and comfortable.</p>\n<p><strong>Leisurely indulgences:</strong> Whether you like to spend your time off pursuing outdoor activities, doing a little shopping, or savoring a hot cup of coffee, nonwovens touch your life. Marine sails, tent materials, shopping bags, and even coffee filters and tea bags are all made from nonwoven textiles.</p>\n<h4>Better Lives through Better Products</h4>\n<p>\u201cAs consumers become more demanding and products must improve to remain competitive, the manufacturing technology behind these materials needs to change, as well,\u201d says Ingo M\u00e4hlmann, vice president, Oerlikon Nonwoven. The nonwoven technology team at Oerlikon focuses on developing innovative manufacturing processes that improve textile durability and functionality while maintaining sustainable production standards. Some of these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nonwoven meltblown technology provides extremely high industrial wipe production capacity without sacrificing quality.</li>\n<li>The joint venture with Teknoweb Materials (TKWM) / Italy offers hybrid technology lines to manufacture high quality wipe nonwovens for a wide variety of end-uses. The technology dispenses with hydro entanglement and subsequent drying resulting in energy and cost savings for customers. The newly-created, combined technology offers considerable synergy potential and the ideal pre-requisites for launching innovative products.</li>\n<li>A new multi-functional forming table for meltblown nonwoven production allows customers to produce various types of meltblown nonwoven textiles with just one production line, enabling customers to develop their own innovative products and differentiate themselves within their markets.</li>\n<li>For the efficient production of needlepunched spunbond nonwovens for geotextile purposes, Oerlikon developed an efficient and disruptive new process. The company will be the first to offer this technology to the marketplace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The near future is dedicated to simplify the Oerlikon Nonwoven processes by automation,&#8221; M\u00e4hlmann says. &#8220;This is why Oerlikon\u2019s nonwoven business is focusing on intelligent automation and industry 4.0 developments implementing sensors and actor.&#8221; As smart machines and innovative new manufacturing approaches continue to evolve, so will the applications and possibilities for nonwovens in even more areas of life.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/06/27/this-type-of-textile-affects-virtually-every-area-of-your-life/\">This type of textile affects virtually every area of your life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/06/27/this-type-of-textile-affects-virtually-every-area-of-your-life/feed/  2     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/#comments  Fri, 04 May 2018 13:59:50 +0000  Oerlikon  Automotive  Manmade fibers  Oerlikon Barmag  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2233  <p>The Hidden Fibers that Keep You Safer on the Road</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/\">Do you know what&#8217;s in your tires?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><strong><em>While many don&#8217;t give much thought to tire yarns, relentless process improvement and exceptional machinery are delivering safer, more durable, and lighter-weight options for partners and consumers.</em></strong></p>\n<div class=\"tire-map\">\n    <img src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/background.jpg\" alt=\"Tire\" class=\"view\" />\n    <img src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/indicators.png\" alt=\"\" usemap=\"#imgmap20180504\" class=\"indicators\" />\n    <map id=\"imgmap20180504\" name=\"imgmap20180504\">\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"25,25,668,204\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/hidden-fibers.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"330,217,836,445\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/giraffe.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"624,481,839,991\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/lego.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"1,996,661,1218\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/dollar.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"12,625,567,977\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/tireyarn.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n        <area shape=\"rect\" coords=\"12,218,325,584\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/themes/tomorrowstories/build/pics/tire-map/bicycle.jpg\" target=\"_self\" />\n    </map>\n</div>\n<p><em>By Gwen Moran</em></p>\n<p>Many people think of tires as being made from durable slabs of synthetic material. However, they don&#8217;t realize that material is made from many high modulus, low shrinkage (HMLS) yarns that are manufactured into the familiar forms that moves our vehicles along the world&#8217;s highways, roads, and other surfaces and terrain.</p>\n<h4>Championship League</h4>\n<p>However, creating these versatile, durable industrial fibers is no easy feat. Tire manufacturers demand increasingly more durable materials that maintain their stability in extreme temperatures and in rigorous use. Doing so requires innovation at every level of the manufacturing process\u2014especially in tire cord production.</p>\n<p>The high temperatures and fast speeds at which polymer materials need to be melted and spun require specialized, high-performance machinery to deliver fibers that are sufficiently tear-resistant, but elastic and temperature as well as dimensionally stable. The higher the spinning and winding speeds, the more sensitive the filaments respond to even the slightest irregularities in polymer melt, possibly resulting in breakage that can affect quality. Oerlikon Barmag is one of just two companies worldwide that deliver machine solutions for the production of HMLS yarn.</p>\n<p>&#8220;HMLS yarn machines are &#8216;champion\u2019s league&#8217; among industrial yarn machines,&#8221; says Markus Reichwein, Oerlikon Barmag&#8217;s Head of Product Management. The machinery components must remain stable under punishing conditions. In addition, process engineers must continuously optimize the spinning process from melt to yarn to meet customers&#8217; high expectations.</p>\n<h4>Improved Performance</h4>\n<p>As a result, Oerlikon&#8217;s machines are able to achieve the world&#8217;s fastest spinning process with speeds of around 6300m/min and temperatures reaching as high as 260\u00b0C. In addition, the team intensively reviews product performance at every stage of the tire cord manufacture\u2014including, twisting, weaving and dipping\u2014to ensure that the final treated fabric meets rigorous standards and to identify possible process and machine improvements, adds Roy Dolmans, Team Leader of Industrial Yarn Process at Oerlikon Barmag.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With our latest developments it is possible to process higher polymer viscosities at lower temperatures,&#8221; Dolmans says. The result is a moderate treatment that produces a thicker polymer melt, improving the material&#8217;s tenacity and stability. In other words, tougher materials from which to make tires.</p>\n<h4>Sustainable Innovation</h4>\n<p>Just as constant innovation leads to improvements in manufacturing processes and outcomes, it also has an impact on sustainability. Customers want to know that their manufacturing partners have environmentally sound practices. Oerlikon&#8217;s EvoQuench manufacturing process reduces the air volume necessary to solidify molten filaments. In addition, the use of high-frequency heating coils inside some components lead to less energy loss while heating the yarn faster and more precisely than conventional heating technology.</p>\n<p>As the market shifts, both Dolmans and Reichwein say that there is a strong push for process automation to minimize labor costs, improve efficiency, and increase yarn quality. Tire manufacturers are looking for more durable fabrics that can manage the same load at a lower weight. Through process improvement and digitization, companies like Oerlikon Barmag have greater methods of handling, visualizing and analyzing data to improve efficiency and save money while delivering on customer expectations.</p>\n<p>Achieving those varied facets of improvement &#8220;requires not only a very high competency and accuracy in designing and manufacturing the machines, it also requires deep HMLS process know how to exactly define the correct hardware specification as well as also the required process settings,&#8221; Reichwein says. When achieved, it is the consumer who ultimately benefits from an affordable, exceptional product, sustainably produced.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/\">Do you know what&#8217;s in your tires?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/05/04/do-you-know-whats-in-your-tires/feed/  2     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/04/20/innovation-is-in-our-dna/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/04/20/innovation-is-in-our-dna/#comments  Fri, 20 Apr 2018 08:07:34 +0000  Oerlikon  Additive manufacturing  Aerospace  Automotive  Oerlikon Balzers  Oerlikon Barmag  Oerlikon Graziano  Oerlikon Metco  Oerlikon Neumag  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2206  <p>Disruptive technologies and solutions at the 2018 Oerlikon Innovation Day</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/04/20/innovation-is-in-our-dna/\">\u201cInnovation is in our DNA\u201d</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><em><strong>100 investors, customers and representatives of the media and universities met in Lucerne for Oerlikon\u2019s first Innovation Day.</strong></em></p>\n<p>New technologies are constantly changing our markets.

The legendary gas turbine plant at Huttenstra\u00dfe. Ayhan Cetin walks through the final assembly hall. In the middle of the hall, an order is being completed for an SGT5-4000F turbine. In a few weeks\u2019 time, this mighty, high-performance machine will be shipped from nearby Westhafen to the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Research engineer Cetin now walks up the stairs to a gallery. From here, we see an area at the rear of the hall surrounded by white sound barriers. This is the gas turbine test bed. This, says Cetin, is where current products and new technologies are \u201cput through their paces.\u201d Several thousand measuring points provide information about performance, efficiency, effectiveness, emission levels and much more. Outsiders can only guess at what goes on behind these sound barriers. What we learn from Cetin is that the facility\u2019s water brake plays a vital role.</p>\n<h4><strong>Extreme pressure creates challenges</strong></h4>\n<p>The water brake consists of a steel case that contains a rotor comprising multiple wheel discs. The material: a low-alloy steel. Cetin can talk about the water brake for hours, although his explanations are more suited to the experts \u2013 just as when he waxes lyrical about the theory of boundary layer friction in turbulent flow. Put simply, high shear and friction forces cause thermal energy to be produced and extracted from the heat transfer medium (water). Depending on the regulatable flow rate and the effective frictional surface, a torque is created that works against the gas turbine that\u2019s being tested and thus absorbs the energy produced.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Cetin was appointed system supervisor of the water brake system at the Berlin gas turbine test bed, the largest of its kind in the world. The challenges associated with a facility of this size are huge. The water brake, in particular, is subject to extreme stress and must be inspected constantly to ensure uninterrupted operation. Cetin is therefore all the more delighted to have recently succeeded in optimizing the water brake in collaboration with Oerlikon Balzers. This involved making the wheel discs more hard-wearing. The process: plasma nitriding. The product: BALITHERM\u00ae IONIT. The result: longer inspection intervals. But let\u2019s go back to the beginning.</p>\n<p>Siemens AG is one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the field of power generation, and gas and steam turbines form the core business of the technology group. To define its portfolio, it is testing prototypes of new products and technologies. Development times and costs are deciding factors when it comes to the profitability of any company, and the high availability of the gas turbine test bay is therefore essential for Siemens PG.</p>\n<p>In a conventional gas turbine power plant, the energy created is absorbed by the generator. In the Berlin gas turbine test bed, however, this is not the case. Here, no continuous power generation can be guaranteed, and thus it cannot be fed into the grid. The mechanical output of the gas turbine is therefore converted into waste heat via the water brake, which in effect replaces the generator and absorbs the energy produced.</p>\n<h4><strong>What can protect against corrosion and cavitation?</strong></h4>\n<p>The Berlin gas turbine test bed was built in 1972, with the water brake following in 1975. Over the decades, however, the demands placed on the facility increased constantly. While 100 megawatts were originally marked as the maximum total output for the test bay, this has since increased to 360 megawatts. Nowhere else in the world other than at Siemens in Berlin are these values achieved.</p>\n<p>For a long time, the greatest challenge was presented by the functionality of the wheel discs of the water brake. The wheel discs\u2019 material is susceptible to corrosion, which is triggered as soon as contact with moisture occurs. Rust, for its part, results in the creation of cavitation, which can significantly damage the wheel discs. Cetin mentions centrifugal and coriolis forces and talks about tremendous turbulence in the system. \u201cIn many cases,\u201d he says, \u201ccavitation is caused as a result of high flow rates. As the rate increases, the static pressure of the liquid falls. If it falls to below vapor pressure, vapor bubbles are formed that are carried along in the flow and can suddenly implode. This results in the formation of microjets that cause material damage with their high speed and extreme pressure load.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cavitation leads to vibration problems, imbalances that can impair the function of the water brake. Should several wheel discs fail, for example, the brake can no longer be operated, and the gas turbine test bed is out of action. While the discs can be mechanically reworked or exchanged if necessary, this would result in frequent inspections and high maintenance costs. There were times, says Cetin, when the wheel discs were unusable after relatively few hours of operation.</p>\n<h4><strong>Siemens and Oerlikon: Solving it hand-in-hand</strong></h4>\n<p>The preliminary discussions between Siemens PG and Oerlikon were held in autumn 2014. Oerlikon Balzers\u2019 Martin Fromme says: \u201cThe economic objective was to significantly increase the lifespan of the wheels.\u201d The first tests and basic analysis were carried out at the Clausthal University of Technology in 2015, and the first samples were prepared in 2016. Plasma nitriding with BALITHERM IONIT involves diffusing nitrogen 0.2 millimeters into the steel. In the test phase, the nitrided brake discs showed no corrosion or cavitation after 25% more hours of operation. \u201cThe discs looked almost the same as they did on the first day,\u201d says Cetin. The first series went into production at the beginning of 2017.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2181\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-1069x801.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1069\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-1069x801.jpg 1069w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-667x500.jpg 667w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Siemens-SGT5-4000F-Gas-Turbine_nah-1201x900.jpg 1201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1069px) 100vw, 1069px\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>We couldn\u2019t ask for more</strong></h4>\n<p>Now, nine months later, Ayhan Cetin still has no cause for complaint. On the contrary. Recently, a gas turbine was tested at 50 hertz. The result: no cavitation, not even any corrosion. \u201cHowever,\u201d says Cetin, \u201cwe have not yet reached the wear limit. I believe that in the future we can even aim to increase the lifespan of the wheel discs by two or three times, ideally even more.\u201d Cetin is also confident about the turbine currently in the test bed: \u201cI do not anticipate any significant maintenance, or that the brake discs will need to be replaced.\u201d So, does this mean that everything ran smoothly with the collaboration between Siemens PG and Oerlikon? \u201cWe are able to save time and money, and to improve the performance of the test bay,\u201d says Cetin. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t ask for more.\u201d</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>AYHAN CETIN</strong>, born 1977, studied mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Berlin, where he specialized in design technology.

The leading architect Peter Behrens was commissioned to give the building an aesthetic and unmistakable appearance without concealing its industrial significance. The result was one of clear elegance, despite the vastness of the building. It is also extremely rare for a factory building to have served its original purpose for over 100 years. The 1 000th gas turbine was produced in 2016.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/23/running-smoothly/\">Running smoothly</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/23/running-smoothly/feed/  2     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/#comments  Wed, 07 Mar 2018 14:06:48 +0000  Oerlikon  Mobility  Automotive  E-mobility  Gearbox  Oerlikon Graziano  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2164  <p>Why are short-range electric trucks so much more energy efficient than long-range?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/\">Trucking Goes Green</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><strong><em>Tesla made a big splash with the announcement of its Semi electric truck with a planned top 800 km (500 mile) range.

One way to cut the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change is to make trucks electric.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk recently announced Tesla&#8217;s first electric truck, the Semi, but the move had already started. Traditional manufacturers, including Daimler, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Cummins, and startups have been pushing to introduce their own electric trucks.</p>\n<p>E-mobility in commercial transport may sound futuristic, but it&#8217;s already mainstream. Logistics and transport companies DHL and Ryder in the U.S., Titanium Transportation Group in Canada, and Italy&#8217;s Fercam have all placed small initial orders of the Tesla Semi, when it eventually ships. The more trucks can be converted from fossil fuels to electric, the better the environment (assuming the constant growth of renewable sources) \u2014 and, potentially, the cheaper the cost of transportation because of enormous energy savings.</p>\n<p>First attempts to hybridize trucks\u2019 powertrains already demonstrated their potential. Long-distance hauling could reduce overall energy use by 2 percent to 4 percent. Short-distance transport, with a higher amount of braking that can be used to recharge batteries, can achieve between 15 percent and 25 percent savings. As for passenger cars, the ambition is to achieve a full powertrain electrification.</p>\n<p>However, big challenges remain to the further development of electric trucks. One model of the Tesla Semi will have an 800 km (500 mile) range. &#8220;Referring to the official Tesla figures, this would mean a consumption of about 125 kilowatt-hours per 100 kilometers,&#8221; says David Gagliardi, Director, Business Development Automotive and Global Hybrids and E-Drives of Oerlikon Graziano.</p>\n<p>The problem is storing the electricity in the truck. For the Tesla Semi, the required battery would be massive. &#8220;If you get one battery with 1,000 kWh, it is like having ten times the batteries of a Tesla S100,&#8221; Gagliardi says. That would be a 7.5 tonnes (16,500 lbs.) battery: nearly 20 percent of the weight capacity of the largest EU trucks.</p>\n<p>Charging batteries, particularly long-distance trucking, is also tricky. Transport companies would need a web of charging stations \u2014 the electrical equivalent of diesel truck stops.</p>\n<p>Musk has said that he wanted the trucks to charge 80 percent of their battery capacity in half an hour. &#8220;It means a power of 1.6 megawatts in the charging station,&#8221; Gagliardi says. That would be like having a small power station instead of a diesel pump. &#8220;There is no infrastructure in the world currently able to sustain this type of power demand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Such problems can and will be addressed over time, and possibly faster than anyone thinks. A decade ago, experts predicted that a kilowatt-hour of power storage in a battery would drop to $250 by 2020. But innovation made the estimate obsolete. &#8220;There are companies already buying batteries for $150 per kilowatt-hour,&#8221; Gagliardi says.</p>\n<p>One design task facing manufacturers is the gearing and drive train necessary to power an electric truck. The working principles are the same as those of an electric passenger car, but trucks need far more mechanical power to move their loads.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can either increase the electric motor torque or increase its speed for more power,&#8221; Gagliardi says. Increasing speed is cheaper than increasing the torque, which requires longer vehicles. Higher speeds, though, bring other considerations, like high-pitched motor noise and stringent design considerations for gear boxes. However, gear and drive train design companies like Oerlikon Graziano are finding new ways to meet those challenges.</p>\n<p>Oerlikon Graziano has 20 years of experience in developing e-mobility vehicles, from the first golf/utility transaxle to contemporary transfer cases that enable light commercial vehicles, including zero-emission city cars.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/\">Trucking Goes Green</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/03/07/trucking-goes-green/feed/  2     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/02/15/were-talking-about-using-materials-and-creating-materials-in-a-whole-new-way/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/02/15/were-talking-about-using-materials-and-creating-materials-in-a-whole-new-way/#respond  Thu, 15 Feb 2018 08:31:51 +0000  Oerlikon  Urbanization  Additive manufacturing  MTC  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2141  <p>Interview with TV journalist Melinda Crane on AM\u2019s news-making potential.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/02/15/were-talking-about-using-materials-and-creating-materials-in-a-whole-new-way/\">\u201cWe\u2019re talking about using materials and creating materials in a whole new way.\u201d</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><em>After moderating the 1st Munich Technology Conference, journalist Melinda Crane discusses additive manufacturing\u2019s news-making potential.</em></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2142\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon MTC\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1.jpg 3000w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1-1202x801.jpg 1202w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bodytext-1-1350x900.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /></p>\n<p><em>By Randy B. Hecht</em></p>\n<p>When Melinda Crane was invited to moderate the 1<sup>st</sup> Munich Technology Conference (MTC), she had only a \u201cgeneral layman\u2019s knowledge\u201d of the process she knew as 3D printing. As a journalist, she quickly came to appreciate Additive Manufacturing (AM) for both its capacity to reinvent manufacturing and for its news potential.</p>\n<p>\u201cI came back from the conference with a sense of having had revealed to me an entire new field,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>The scale of AM\u2019s current and projected capabilities in, for example, producing automobile and airplane parts was just the beginning of what Crane found noteworthy. Equally impressive in her view was \u201cthe fact that we\u2019re talking about using materials and creating materials in a whole new way. That has profound implications for every phase of the value chain.\u201d</p>\n<p>The certification and quality control implications also caught her attention and ranked among the most interesting discoveries she made at the conference. \u201cWe\u2019re talking in some cases about materials with entirely new properties,\u201d she says. \u201cI find that absolutely fascinating. You could say we stand at the threshold of truly a whole new era that will revolutionize applied materials science.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a background in both law and economics, Crane naturally gravitates toward topics that feature interdisciplinary elements, and here, again, AM did not disappoint. She describes herself as fascinated by the way \u201cthis pushes the boundaries between sectors and between academic disciplines\u201d and by \u201chow we get a systemic approach that may be a challenge for some of us coming from the old world of manufacturing.\u201d</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2143 size-full\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon MTC\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M.jpg 3000w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M-1202x801.jpg 1202w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02_02_MTC_01-031_M-1350x900.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /></p>\n<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> MTC has been scheduled for October 11-12, 2018, and Crane will return to moderate again. Thinking about themes that are still unfolding in this sphere and news that may emerge between now and the next conference, she lists several topics that she\u2019ll be following.</p>\n<p>Cost developments \u201cwill be very interesting to watch,\u201d she says. \u201cOne thing that became clear from the conference is that AM methods make sense when you\u2019re talking about very high value parts like jet engine parts. But there will need to be significant developments before this becomes cost-effective at scale in, for example, the auto industry as a whole. Watching how processes develop and costs develop will be a fascinating aspect.\u201d</p>\n<p>In her view as a journalist, another good story is \u201chow we certify control quality in the field and how we are going to have to rethink certification and quality control,\u201d she says. \u201cThat may sound like a dusty academic topic, but it\u2019s of crucial importance. One story that was told at the conference was of an aircraft part that had been designed but couldn\u2019t be put into use because they couldn\u2019t figure out how to sign off on it in terms of certification. So that development, too, I think will be fascinating.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks forward to hearing more about each of these aspects of AM during the 2018 MTC and is eager to learn about \u201cnew applications and the way additive challenges business models.\u201d And finally, as a journalist who frequently covers stories related to economic policy, she hopes to hear \u201cmore about how the different stakeholders can and must work together to bring this really exciting technology forward.\u201d</p>\n<p>She asks, \u201cWhat kind of a push is it going to take from academia and from policy makers to really bring this forward?\u201d And in that question, she captures the central idea of the MTC: to bring together representatives of industry, academia, government, and associations to partner in creating the future of manufacturing. As MTC host, Oerlikon is delighted to count on Crane\u2019s collaboration as conference moderator\u2014and with her, awaits the next breaking news about this remarkable field.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2156\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon MTC\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3.jpg 3000w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3-1202x801.jpg 1202w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Intranet-SM-Bodytext-3-1350x900.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Born in the U.S.A. and based in Germany, journalist and moderator Melinda Crane brings to her work an educational background that includes law and economics.

Based at the technical university in Delft, The Netherlands, its 130 members share a big dream: to reach outer space. Using materials and technologies from Oerlikon Metco, they have moved a significant step closer to their lofty goal.</em></p>\n<p><script src=\"https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js\" async></script></p>\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\">\n<div class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_0hqfbsk651 dnt=1 seo=false videoFoam=true\" style=\"height:100%;width:100%\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Until 2016, the students from Delft held the European altitude record for a rocket built by students. That year, the record was snatched from them by the team at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. With the Stratos III, DARE\u2019s largest project, they hope to bring the record back to The Netherlands \u2014 and build on the momentum generated by the Stratos I and Stratos II+ rockets\u2019 success. A flight altitude of 32,300 meters will achieve this goal. However, the group working with Felix Lindemann, the Stratos III team leader, is aiming for a good deal more: \u201cIf everything works right, then our rocket will achieve a flight altitude of 60 to 80 km,\u201d he explains.</p>\n<h4><strong>The engine as an influencing variable</strong></h4>\n<p>He notes that \u201ca prognosis like this is always a bit risky.\u201d That\u2019s because flight altitude potential depends on quite a few considerations. The air density at the launch site and the wind conditions in the atmosphere are just two of the variables. Each has considerable influence but can be calculated with only limited accuracy.</p>\n<p>What can be controlled by the rocket builders (and is therefore of decisive importance) is combustion time: how long the engine burns. It must generate the necessary thrust, and every tenth of a second of combustion time results in more meters in altitude. For this reason, the engine is being thoroughly tested during the development phase, Lindemann explains: \u201cAt the moment, we have achieved a combustion time of 15 seconds for the rocket engine. Our goal is to increase this to 28 seconds.\u201d</p>\n<h4><strong>Hot nozzle</strong></h4>\n<p>However, a longer combustion time also means higher temperatures at the nozzle. The flame in the combustion chamber is about 3,000 K hot, or somewhat more than 2,700 degrees Celsius. At the outlet of the nozzle, the temperature is still about 2,000 K. \u201cThis temperature is influenced by the shape of the nozzle, which, in turn, is also a significant factor for the thrust,\u201d says Felix Lindemann. \u201cThe nozzle must not become deformed under any circumstances, even when subject to such a high thermal load.\u201d</p>\n<p>In order to optimize the engine and the ignition sequence, test nozzles made of graphite are being manufactured first. This material provides sufficient thermal stability, but is too heavy for later use in the actual rocket. Consequently, Lindemann\u2019s team is working with a hybrid structure for these components in which only the parts that are subject to the greatest thermal loading are made of graphite. However, the calculations are turning out to be a challenge: \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that we are working at the very limits of what is technically possible as to whether and how many components in the nozzle can be replaced \u2014 and whether this will prove worthwhile in the end,\u201d he says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2118\" style=\"max-width: 1410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2118 size-full\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20170713_114039-e1517475813726.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon DARE Rocket nozzle Metco\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1094\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Material and technology from Metco: Outlet of the Stratos III nozzle, additively manufactured with a titanium alloy powder and treated with a heat-protecting coating made of zirconium oxide.</p></div>\n<h4><strong>Material and technology from Oerlikon Metco</strong></h4>\n<p>Oerlikon Metco is providing the young researchers with support in the development work. The company is supplying a highly temperature-resistant titanium alloy powder to DARE project corporate partner 3D Systems, which is building the nozzle outlet using the additive manufacturing process with laser melding. The demands for temperature stability would not be met by titanium alone: \u201cIn order to reduce the thermal load, Oerlikon Metco had the idea of additionally coating the component with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide at their Swiss location,\u201d says Felix Lindemann. And he is pleased at the current status of the development work: \u201cTwo nozzles have already been tested and the results are very promising: At least the two last centimeters of the so-called \u2018divergent section,\u2019 meaning the outermost part of the outlet, can be replaced with this material.\u201d</p>\n<h4><strong>End spurt</strong></h4>\n<p>The rocket is not yet ready for launch. Many tests are still pending before the exact launch date can be determined. As things stand today, though, all should be ready by the early part of 2018. Until then, Lindemann says, the students have a good deal to do, as \u201c70 hours per week and sometimes more is the standard for members of the core team.\u201d</p>\n<p>DARE is no \u201cextra-curricular\u201d activity. Semester breaks are being sacrificed and semesters on leave invested. But an enthusiastic student member says it is worthwhile: \u201cWe love what we are doing here. We have a great deal of freedom in the project and are able to develop and make decisions ourselves.

Hecht</em></p>\n<p>The fantasy of time travel is that it takes us not just to another era, but in some ways to another planet\u2014one that lacks our modern capabilities and conveniences. We imagine experiencing Florence during the age of Michelangelo and da Vinci, being witness to court intrigues in Elizabethan England, or sharing beer and conversation with Ben Franklin after one of his experiments. At the same time, we can\u2019t conceive of being truly \u201cunplugged,\u201d cut off from science and technology, and left to survive in an analog world.</p>\n<p>But in some ways, the past would be more familiar than we imagine. You\u2019ve heard the expression \u201cthe winds of change.\u201d Well, it turns out that wind has been powering technological change for more than 7000 years.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how long ago Egyptian sailors were harnessing wind power to navigate the Nile. In the Middle East, windmills were in widespread use for food production by the 11<sup>th</sup> century. Dutch traders brought the idea home to the Netherlands, where windmill power was used to manage water levels in the Rhine River Delta. And when the electrical grid was still in its infancy, wind farms made up for gaps in its coverage and brought lighting to homes and buildings in remote locations.</p>\n<p>Today, the wind industry is generating jobs as well as renewable energy. It employed 1.1 million people globally as of the end of 2015, and by 2020, it\u2019s expected to provide jobs for 520,000 people in the EU alone. Wind power plants generate 3.7 percent of energy consumed globally, a figure that\u2019s expected to rise dramatically as wind power sustains double-digit annual growth.</p>\n<p>Already, wind energy systems are installed in 80 countries, led by China, the U.S.A., Germany, and India. Given that China and India represent more than a third of the world\u2019s population, the long-term market potential for wind energy is clear.</p>\n<p>This is good news for companies that manufacture wind turbines and components, but that good news is tempered by emerging challenges. To meet increasing demand, wind energy equipment is becoming physically larger, which places additional stress on turbines and individual parts.</p>\n<p>One example is the ring gear in a modern wind turbine\u2019s gear box. The ring\u2019s diameter may be as great as three meters, which presents a risk of warping. Other components ensure optimal operating efficiency: yaw rings position the nacelle\u2014the upper part of the system\u2014to ensure that it faces right into the wind, while pitch gears position the rotor blades to maximize energy exploitation. Each of these parts must operate at peak performance, and each therefore must be protected against wear, erosion, and corrosion.</p>\n<p>Engineers at Oerlikon work in collaboration with manufacturers to meet those challenges and develop solutions that contribute to wind energy\u2019s potential. One resulting innovation is treatment of ring gears with Balitherm Ionit, a plasma nitriding process from Oerlikon Balzers that achieves a significant reduction in warping and increases load-bearing capacity.</p>\n<p>Equally important improvements in the protection are available for yaw rings and pitch gears. Zinc or zinc-aluminum coatings applied via electric arc wire spraying reduce their risk of corrosion. The Oerlikon Metco team in Weissenborn, Germany even developed a means of using thermal spraying to regenerate and repair damaged rotor shafts to extend their useful lives.</p>\n<p>No one can pull innovation out of thin air. But now\u2014as throughout history\u2014creative minds are finding ways to put innovation <em>into</em> the air and the power it generates. By building on past achievements, new engineering developments are making wind a significant resource in the world\u2019s renewable energy future.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/01/25/wind-turbines/\">Remarkably renewable</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/01/25/wind-turbines/feed/  0     https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/01/11/elegance-and-functionality/ https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/01/11/elegance-and-functionality/#comments  Thu, 11 Jan 2018 13:20:42 +0000  Oerlikon  Urbanization  Additive manufacturing  https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/?p=2069  <p>Urban cycling, redesigned and redefined </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/2018/01/11/elegance-and-functionality/\">Elegance and functionality</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories\">Oerlikon Blog - Without limits</a>.</p>  <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Top-1.jpg\" alt=\"Oerlikon Urwahn Additive Manufacturing\" width=\"2835\" height=\"1831\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Top-1.jpg 2835w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Top-1-774x500.jpg 774w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Top-1-768x496.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Top-1-1240x801.jpg 1240w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Top-1-1394x900.jpg 1394w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2835px) 100vw, 2835px\" /></p>\n<p><em>The team at Urwahn that works with start-up founder Sebastian Meinecke keeps the objective clearly in focus: A bicycle conceived for city use that commands respect due to both an innovative frame and a minimalist design. While developing the \u201cStadtfuchs,\u201d Urwahn relied on technology and support from Oerlikon subsidiary citim, which works in the area of additive manufacturing of metal components. </em></p>\n<p>Sebastian Meinecke is a sports engineer, product designer and enthusiastic bicyclist. He financed his education by establishing his own production facility, in which he built truly distinctive bicycles. Even then, he was already passionately involved in the areas of design, functionality and integration. Nonetheless, he wanted more: \u201cMy dream was to develop a bicycle on my own that elegantly unified design and functionality, was specifically adapted to suit the everyday circumstances of the city and thereby to take urban mobility to a whole new level.\u201d</p>\n<p>The idea simply never let him go, and his enthusiasm proved contagious. He persuaded Konrad J\u00f6r\u00df and Ramon Thomas, members of the scientific staff at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, to join him in the development of a new type of bicycle. Soon they registered a patent and founded the start-up \u201cUrwahn Engineering.\u201d The term \u201cUr-wahn\u201d is a coinage which, in German, clearly underscores the young founders\u2019 objective: Urban (ur) engineering connected with the passion, even obsession, and the committed determination (wahn) to create new, innovative and perhaps previously unimagined products.</p>\n<h4><strong>Elegant appearance, outstanding functionality</strong></h4>\n<p>Motivated and driven by the interdisciplinary model of \u201cIntegrated Design Engineering,\u201d Urwahn places humans and their needs at the focus of their bicycle conceptualization. The central innovation that arose in this connection is a completely new type of bicycle frame whose design is a complete departure from the well-known trapezoidal shape. Employing a comprehensive form closure of the front and rear parts, they succeeded in giving the rear wheel an elastic suspension. This helps absorb shocks on rough terrain. By eliminating typical commercially-available spring suspension systems, they reduced weight while retaining a comfortable ride. Further innovative details, such as powerful LED lighting and a GPS tracking system that serves as a theft deterrent are fully integrated in the frame and make the bicycle truly unique. \u201cOur constant focus at every turn was a reduction to the most basic elements, which is the source of the bicycle\u2019s delicate and elegant appearance,\u201d describes Sebastian Meinecke.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2079\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"6987\" height=\"4663\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid.jpg 6987w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid-749x500.jpg 749w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Mid-1349x900.jpg 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6987px) 100vw, 6987px\" /></p>\n<h4>\u201c3D printing\u201d for a unique result</h4>\n<p>The frame of the \u201cStadtfuchs V2\u201d (\u201cCity Fox V2\u201d) was fabricated in Barleben, Germany, by citim GmbH, which is part of the Oerlikon Group. It is made of 1.4404 stainless steel, a very highly corrosion resistant chrome-nickel-molybdenum steel, which was shaped by means of additive manufacturing. Using the process of Selective Laser Melting (SLM), the powdered material was applied and melted layer by layer, which results in the creation of a three-dimensional object. This manufacturing process opens up completely new shaping and forming possibilities and thus the production of component geometries which would be unthinkable with other production processes.</p>\n<p>Founded in 1996 as a spin-off (as was Urwahn itself) of the Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg, citim specializes in additive manufacturing of metal components. This process eliminates the costly and time-intensive mold-making procedure and thus makes it possible to create prototypes in a short time. The component can be modified quickly and without complications during the development process. \u201cOur collaboration with citim was fantastic,\u201d states Sebastian Meinecke. \u201cWe were assisted by the citim team in every respect, both in the selection of the most suitable manufacturing process as well as in the design of the frame and ultimately, even in the perfecting of the frame\u2019s surface finish.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the context of the ego.-Gr\u00fcndungstransfer programme, their project received funding from the European Regional Development Fund via the Saxony-Anhalt Investment Bank. Because the subsidies were approved for only a limited time period, the team was under tremendous deadline pressure. \u201cTogether with citim, we were nonetheless able to produce a fully functional prototype within a matter of only a few weeks,\u201d explains the product designer.</p>\n<h4>Internationally successful, anchored in the region</h4>\n<p>The \u201cStadtfuchs\u201d has engendered international excitement since its unveiling. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re very pleased about this. Of almost greater importance for us, however, is that we have developed a product than is strongly anchored in the region,\u201d Sebastian Meinecke notes enthusiastically. \u201cWe not only use sustainable processes and materials for production, but are also creating jobs at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The \u201cStadtfuchs\u201d will soon be available on the market. The Urwahn team is already brewing up new ideas. We are looking forward to further surprises.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2088\" style=\"max-width: 2510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-2088 size-full\" src=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" srcset=\"https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new.jpg 2500w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new-750x500.jpg 750w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new-1201x801.jpg 1201w, https://www.oerlikon.com/stories/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Urwahn_Blog_Bot_new-1350x900.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Perfectionists: The Urwahn Engineering team with Konrad J\u00f6r\u00df, Ramon Thomas and Sebastian Meinecke (from left)</p></div>\n<h4>Urwahn Engineering</h4>\n<p>Urwahn Engineering is a start-up launched in 2016 and located in Magdeburg, Germany.
